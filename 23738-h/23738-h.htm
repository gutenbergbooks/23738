<p>The house cried out to me for help.</p>

<p>In the after-knowledge I now possess of what
was to happen there, that impression is not more
clearly definite than it was at my first sight of the
place. Let me at once set down that this is not the
story of a haunted house. It is, or was, a beleaguered
house; strangely besieged as was Prague in
the old legend, when a midnight army of spectres
unfurled pale banners and encamped around the
city walls.</p>

<p>Of course, I did not know all this, the day that
my real-estate agent brought his little car to a stop
before the dilapidated farm. I believed the house
only appealed to be lived in; for deliverance from
the destroying work of neglect and time. A spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
rain was whispering down from a gray sky, dripping
from broken gutters and eaves with a patter like
timid footsteps hurrying by, yet even in the storm
the house did not look dreary.</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Locke, is a bargain," the agent
called back to me, where I sat in my car. "Finest
bit in Connecticut for a city man's summer home!
Woodland, farm land, lake and a house that only
needs a few repairs to be up-to-date. Look at that
double row of maples, sir. Shade all summer!
Fine old orchard, too; with a trifle of attention."</p>

<p>I nodded, surveying the house with an eagerness
of interest that surprised myself. A box-like, fairly
large structure of commonplace New England ugliness,
it coaxed my liking as had no other place I had
ever seen; it wooed me like a determined woman.
And as one would long to clothe beautifully a beloved
woman, I looked at the house and foresaw what
an architect could do for it; how creamy stucco;
broad white porches and a gay scarlet roof would
transform it.</p>

<p>"Come inside," my agent urged, hope in his
voice as he observed my face; "let me show you the
interior. I brought the keys along. Of course, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
rooms may seem a bit musty. No one has lived in
it for&mdash;some time. It's the old Michell property;
been in the family for a couple of hundred years.
Last Michell is dead, now, and it's being sold for the
benefit of some religious institute the old gentleman
left it to. Trifle wet to walk over the land today!
But I've a plan and measurements in my portfolio."</p>

<p>I said that we would go in. If he had but known
the fact, the place was already sold to me; before
I left my car, before I entered the house, before I
had seen the hundred-odd acres that make up
the estate.</p>

<p>There was a narrow, flagged path to the veranda,
where the planking moved and creaked under our
weight while my companion unlocked the front door.
Rather astonishingly, the air of the long-closed place
was neither musty nor damp, when we stepped in.
Instead, there was a faint, resinous odor, very pleasant
and clean; perhaps from the cedar of which the
woodwork largely consisted.</p>

<p>The house was partially furnished. Not, of
course, with much that I would care to retain, but
a few good antiques stood out among their commonplace
associates. A large bedroom on the north side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
which I appointed as my own at first sight, held
an old rosewood set including a four-posted, pineapple-carved
bed. I threw open the shutters in this
room and looked out.</p>

<p>I received the first jar to my satisfaction. On
this side of the place, the grounds ran down a
slight slope for perhaps half a block to the five-acre
hollow of shallow water and lush growth which the
agent called a lake. From it flowed a considerable
creek, winding behind the house and away on its
journey to the Sound. For that under-water marsh
I felt a shock of violent dislike.</p>

<p>"You don't care for the lake?" my companion
deprecated, at my elbow. "Fine trout in that stream,
though! I'd like you to see it in the sunshine."</p>

<p>"I should care more for it if it was a lake, not
a swamp," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that is only because the old dam is
down," he exclaimed eagerly. "That lets all the
water out, you see. Why, if the dam were put back,
you'd have as pretty a lake for a canoe as there is in
the State! Its natural depth is four or five feet all
over, and about eight or ten where the stream flows
through to the dam. Even yet, a few wild duck stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
there spring and fall, and when I was a boy I've
seen heron. Put back the dam, Mr. Locke, and I'll
guarantee you'll never say swamp again!"</p>

<p>"We will try it," I said. "Now let us find a
lawyer and see how quickly I can be put in
possession."</p>

<p>We drove back to the little town from which we
had that morning started out, and where my agent
lived; my sleek car following his small one with
somewhat the effect of a long-limbed panther striding
behind an agitated mouse.</p>

<p>It appeared that the sale was simply consummated.
I do not mean that all the formalities were
completed in a day. But by nightfall I could feel
myself the owner of the place.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the giddiness of being a land-owner
for the first time, or perhaps it was the abject
wretchedness of the only hotel in town that inspired
the whim which seized me during my solitary dinner.
I had spent one night here, and did not welcome
the prospect of a second. A return to New York
was not practicable, because I had arranged to meet
several contractors and an architect at the farm,
next morning, to discuss the alterations I wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
made. Why not drive out to my new house this
evening and sleep tonight in the rosewood-furnished
bedroom?</p>

<p>The idea gained favor as I contemplated it. I
could go over the house tonight and sketch more
clearly what I wanted done, while I would be on the
ground when my men arrived next morning. There
was an allure of camping out about it, too.</p>

<p>In the end I went, of course.</p>

<p>It was dark when I stabled my roadster in the
barn that was part of my new possessions; where
the car seemed to glitter disdain of the hay-littered,
ragged shelter. Equipped with a flashlight, suitcase
and bundle, I followed a faint path that wound
its way to the house through wet blackberry vines
whose thorns had outlived the winter. My steps
broke the blank silence that brooded over the place.
At this season there was no insect life; nor any other
stirring thing within hearing or sight. But just as
I stepped upon the veranda, I heard a vague sound
from the lake that lay a few hundred feet to the
north. There was no wind, yet the water had
seemed to move with a sound like the smacking of
soft, glutinous lips. Or as if some soft body drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
itself from a bed of clinging mud. I wondered idly
if the tide could run this far back from Long
Island Sound.</p>

<p>The house reiterated the impression of welcoming
me. I shut and locked the old door behind me,
and went up to the room I had chosen as my own.
There I unshuttered and opened the windows,
lighted one of the candles I had brought and set it
on a little bookcase filled with dingy volumes, and
threw my blankets on the bed. I had moved in!</p>

<p>My pleasant sense of proprietorship continued to
grow. Before I thought of sleep, I had been through
the house several times from cellar to attic and
accumulated a list of things to be done. Back
in my room, an hour passed in revising the list,
by candle-light.</p>

<p>Near ten o'clock, I rolled myself in a dressing-gown
and my blankets, spread an automobile robe
over the four-posted bed, and fell asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Beware of her fair hair, for she excels<br />
All women in the magic of her locks."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">Shelley</span> (<i>Trans.</i>).<br />
</p></div>


<p>It trailed suavely through my fingers, slipping
across my palm like a belt of silk. It glided with
the noiseless haste of a thing in flight. Quite naturally,
even in the dazed moment of awakening I closed
my hand upon it. It was soft in my grasp, yet
resilient; solid, yet supple. If I may speak irrationally,
it felt as if it must be fragrant. It was a
strange visitor to my experience, yet I recognized
its identity unerringly as a blind man gaining sight
might identify a flower or a bird. In brief, it was&mdash;it
only could be an opulent braid of hair.</p>

<p>When I grasped it, it ceased to move.</p>

<p>In the dense darkness of my bedroom, I lay still
and considered. I was alone, or rather, should have
been alone in the old house I had bought the day
before. The agent assured me that it had been unoccupied
for years. Who, then, was my guest? A
passer-by seeking refuge in a supposedly deserted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
house would hardly have moved about with such
silent caution. A tramp of this genus would be a
rarity indeed. I had nothing with me of value to
attract a thief. The usual limited masculine jewelry&mdash;a
watch, a pair of cuff-links, a modest pin&mdash;surely
were not sufficiently tempting to snare so dainty a
bird of prey as one wearing such plumage as I held.
I have not a small fist, yet that braid was a generous
handful. How did it come to trail across my bed,
in any case? And why was its owner locked in
silence and immobility? Surely startled innocence
would have cried out, questioned my grasp or struggled
against it! My captive did neither.</p>

<p>I began to paint a picture against the darkness;
the picture of a crouching woman, fear-paralyzed;
not daring to stir, to sob or pant or shiver lest she
betray herself. Or, perhaps, a woman who was
not hushed by panic, but by deliberation. A woman
who slowly levelled a weapon, assuring her aim in
the blank darkness by such guides as my breathing
and the taut direction of her imprisoned tresses. An
ugly woman could not have such hair as this. Or,
could she? I had a doubtful recollection of various
long-haired demonstrators glimpsed in drugshop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
windows, who were not beautiful. Yes, but they
would never have found themselves in such a situation
as this one! Only resolve or recklessness could
bring a woman to such a pass; and with spirit and
this hair no woman could be ugly.</p>

<p>How quiet she was! I suddenly reflected that
she must be thinking the same thing of me, since
neither of us had moved during a considerable space
of time. Possibly she fancied me only half-aroused,
and hoped that I would relapse into sleep without
realizing upon what my drowsy grasp had closed.
No doubt it would have been the course of chivalry
for me to pretend to do so, but it was not the course
of curiosity.</p>

<p>The deadlock could not last indefinitely. Apparently,
though, it must be I who should break it. As
quietly as possible, I brought my left hand forward
to grope along that silken line which certainly must
guide me to the intruder herself. My hand slipped
along the smooth surface to the full reach of my
arm; and encountered nothing. Check, for the first
attempt! The candle and matches I had bought in
the village were also beyond my reach, unless I released
my captive and rolled across the bed toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the little bookcase where I had placed them beside
the flashlight. If I should speak, what would she
do? And&mdash;a new thought!&mdash;was she alone in
the house?</p>

<p>There came a gentle draw at the braid, instantly
ceasing as I automatically tightened my hold. The
pretense that I slept was ended. I spoke, as soothingly
and kindly as I could manage.</p>

<p>"If you will let me strike a light, we can explain
to each other. Or, if you will agree not to
escape&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>In spite of my efforts, my voice boomed startlingly
through the dark, still room. No reply followed,
but the braid quivered and suddenly relaxed
from its tension. She must have come closer to me.
Delighted by so much success attained and intrigued
by the novelty of the adventure, I moved
slightly, stretching my free arm in the direction
of the flashlight.</p>

<p>"I am not a difficult person," I essayed encouragement.
"Nor too dull, I hope, to understand a
mistake or a necessity. Nor am I affiliated with the
police! Permit me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I halted abruptly. A cool edge of metal had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
been laid across the wrist of my groping hand. As
the hand came to rest, palm uppermost, I could feel,
or imagined I could feel my pulse beating steadily
against the menacing pressure of the blade. The
warning was eloquent and sufficient; I moved no
further toward my flashlight. Of course, if I had
lifted my right hand from its guard of the braid, I
could easily have pinioned the arm which poised the
knife before I suffered much harm. But I might
have lost my captive in the attempt; an event for
which I was not ready, yet.</p>

<p>"Check," I admitted. "Although, it is rather
near a stalemate for us both, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The knife pressed closer, suggestively.</p>

<p>"No," I dissented with the mute argument. "I
think not. I do not believe you could do it; not in
cold blood, anyway!"</p>

<p>"You do not know," insisted the closer pressing
blade, as if with a tongue.</p>

<p>"No, I do not know," I translated aloud. "But
I am confident enough to chance it. What reason
have you for desperate action? I would not harm
you. Have I not a right to curiosity? This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
my house, you know. Or perhaps you did not
know that?"</p>

<p>A sigh stirred the silence, blending with the
ceaseless whisper of the rain that had recommenced
through the night. The braid did not move in my
right hand, nor did the blade touching my left.</p>

<p>"Speak!" I begged, with an abrupt urgency that
surprised myself. "You are the invader. Why?
What would you have from me? If I am to let you
go, at least speak to me, first! This is&mdash;uncanny."</p>

<p>"There is magic in the third time of asking,"
came a breathed, just audible whisper. "Yet, be
warned; call not to you that which you may neither
hold nor forbid."</p>

<p>"But I do call&mdash;if that will make you speak to
me," I returned, my pulses tingling triumph.
"Although, as to not holding you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You fancy you hold me? It is not you
who are master of this moment, but I who am
its mistress."</p>

<p>Her voice had gained in strength; a soft voice,
yet not weak, used with a delicate deliberation that
gave her speech the effect of being a caprice of her
own rather than a result of my compulsion. Yet, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
thought, she must be crouched or kneeling beside
me, on the floor, held like the Lady of the Beautiful
Tresses.</p>

<p>"Still, I doubt if you have the disposition to use
your advantage," I began.</p>

<p>"You mean, the cruelty," she corrected me.</p>

<p>"I am from New York," I smiled. "Let me
say, the nerve. If you pressed that knife, I might
bleed to death, you know."</p>

<p>"Would you hear a story of a woman of my
house, and her anger, before you doubt too far?"</p>

<p>"Tell me," I consented; and smiled in the darkness
at the transparent plan to distract my attention
from that imprisoned braid.</p>

<p>She was silent for so long that I fancied the plan
abandoned, perhaps for lack of a tale to tell. Then
her voice leaped suddenly out of the blackness that
closed us in, speaking always in muted tones, but
with a strange, impassioned urgency and force that
startled like a cry. The words hurried upon one
another like breaking surf.</p>

<p>"See! See! The fire leaps in the chimney; it
breathes sparks like a dreadful beast&mdash;it is hungry;
its red tongues lick for that which they may not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
have. Already its breath is hot upon the wax image
on the hearth. But the image is round of limb and
sound. Yes, though it is but toy-large, it is perfect
and firm! See how it stands in the red shine: the
image of a man, cunningly made to show his stalwartness
and strength and bravery of velvet and
lace! The image of a great man, surely; one
high in place and power. One above fear and
beyond the reach of hate!</p>

<p>"The woman sits in her low chair, behind the
image. The fire-shine is bright in her eyes and in
her hair. On either side her hair flows down to the
floor; her eyes look on the image and are dreadfully
glad. Ha, was not Beauty the lure, and shall it not
be the vengeance?</p>

<p>"The nine lamps have been lighted! The feathers
have been laid in a circle! The spell has been
spoken; the spell of Hai, son of Set, first man to
slay man by the Dark Art!</p>

<p>"The man is at the door of the woman's house.
Yes, he who came in pride to woo, and proved traitor
to the love won&mdash;he is at her door in weakness
and pain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"As the wax wastes, the man wastes! As the
mannikin is gone, the man dies!</p>

<p>"On her doorstep, he begs for life. He is coward
and broken. He suffers and is consumed. He calls
to her the love-names they both know. And the
woman laughs, and the door is barred.</p>

<p>"The door is barred, but what shall bar out the
Enemy who creeps to the nine lamps?</p>

<p>"See, the fire shines through the wax! The
image is grown thin and wan. Three days, three
nights, it has shrunk before the flames. Three days,
three nights, the woman has watched. As the fire is
not weary, she is not weary. As the fire is beautiful,
she is beautiful.</p>

<p>"The man is borne to her door again. He lifts up
his hands and cries to her. But now he begs for
death. Now he knows anguish stronger than fear.
And the woman laughs, and the door is barred.</p>

<p>"The fire shines on a lump of wax. The man is
dead. From her chair the woman has arisen and
stands, triumphant.</p>

<p>"<i>But what crouches behind her, unseen? The
lamps are cast down! The pentagram is crossed!
The Horror takes its own.</i>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>The impassioned speech broke off with the effect
of a snapped bar of thin metal. In the silence, the
steady whisper of rain came to my ears again, continuing
patiently. I became aware of a rich yet
delicate fragrance in the air I breathed. It was not
any perfume I could identify, either as a composition
or as a flower scent. If I may hope to be understood
it sparkled upon the senses. It produced a
thirst for itself, so that the nostrils expanded for it
with an eagerness for the new pleasure. I found
myself breathing deeply, almost greedily, before
answering my prisoner's story.</p>

<p>"'Sister Helen,'" I quoted, as lightly as I could.</p>

<p>"And do you think Rossetti had no truth to base
his poem upon?" her quiet voice flowed out of the
darkness, seeming scarcely the same speech as the
swift, irregular utterance of a moment before. "Do
you think that all the traditions and learning of the
younger world meant&mdash;nothing?"</p>

<p>"Are you asking me to believe in witchcraft
and sorcery?"</p>

<p>"I ask nothing."</p>

<p>"Not even to believe that you will press the
knife if I refuse to free you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>"Not even that; now!"</p>

<p>Compunction smote me. Her voice sounded
more faint, as if from fatigue or discouragement.
It seemed to me that the blade against my wrist had
relaxed its menace of pressure and just rested in
position. I seemed to read my lady's weariness in
the slackened vigilance. Perhaps she was really
frightened, now that her brave attempt to lull me
into incaution had failed.</p>

<p>"Listen, please," I spoke earnestly. "I am
going to set you free. I apologize for keeping you
captive so long! But you will admit the provocation
to my curiosity? You will forgive me?"</p>

<p>A sigh drifted across the darkness.</p>

<p>"I ask no questions," I urged. "But will you
not trust me to make a light and give what help I
can? You are welcome to use the house as you
please. Or, if you are lost or stormbound, my car
is in the old barn and I will drive you anywhere that
you say. Let us not spoil our adventure by suspicion.
In good faith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I opened my hand, releasing the lovely rope by
which I had detained my prisoner. Then, with a
quickening pulse, I waited. Would she stay? Would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
she spring up and escape? Would she thank me, or
would she reply with some eccentricity unpredictable
as her whim to tell me that tale?</p>

<p>She did none of these things. The braid of hair,
freed entirely, continued to lie supinely across my
open palm. The coolness of the blade still lightly
touched my wrist. She might be debating her course
of action, I reflected. Well, I was in no haste to
conclude the episode!</p>

<p>When the silence had lasted many moments,
however, I began to grow restive. Anxiety tinged
my speculations. Suppose she had fainted? Or did
she doubt my intentions, and was her quietness that
of one on guard? I stirred tentatively.</p>

<p>Two things happened simultaneously with my
movement. The braid glided away from me, while
the knife slipped from its position and tinkled upon
the floor. I started up, perception of the truth seizing
my slow wits, and reached for my flashlight.</p>

<p>There was no one in the room except myself.
Down my blanket was slipping a severed braid of
hair, perhaps a foot in length, jaggedly cut across
at the end farthest from my hand. Leaning over, I
saw on the floor beside the bed a paper-knife of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
own; a sharp, serviceable tool that formed part of my
writing kit. Before going to bed, I had taken it
from my suitcase to trim a candle-wick, and had left
it upon the bookstand.</p>

<p>Now I understood why her voice had sounded
more distant than seemed reasonable while I held her
beside me. No doubt she had hacked off the detaining
braid almost as soon as I grasped it. The knife
she had pressed against my wrist to keep me where
I lay while she made ready for flight; or amused
herself with me. Flight? Say rather that she had
leisurely withdrawn! Perhaps she had not even
heard my magnanimous speech offering her the freedom
that she already possessed. If she had stayed
to hear me, probably she had laughed.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was still in the house.</p>

<p>I rose and lighted a candle, under the impulsion
of that idea, reserving my flashlight for the search.
But there was no one in any of the dusty, sparsely
furnished rooms and halls through which I hunted.
The ancient locks on doors and windows were fastened
as I had left them, although my lady certainly
had entered and left at her pleasure. Puzzled and
amused, I finally returned to my bedchamber.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>There was some difference in that room. I was
conscious of the fact as soon as I entered and closed
the door behind me. The candle still burned where
I had left it, flickering slightly in some current of air.
There was no change that the eye could find, no
sound except the rain, yet I felt an extreme reluctance
to go on even a step from where I stood. What I
wanted to do was to tear open the door behind me,
to rush out into the hall and slam the door shut
between this room and myself.</p>

<p>Why? I looked around me, sending the beam of
the flashlight playing over the quiet place. Nothing,
of course! I walked over to the bookcase, took up
the braid I had left there, and sat down in an old
armchair to study my trophy. On principle and by
habit I had no intention of being mastered by nerves.
It was humiliating to discover that I could be made
nervous by the mere fact of being in an unoccupied
farmhouse after midnight.</p>

<p>The braid was magnificent. It was as broad as
my palm, yet compressed so tightly that it was thick
and solid to the touch. If released over someone's
shoulders, it would have been a sumptuous cloak,
indeed! In what madness of panic had the girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
sacrificed this beauty? How she must hate me,
now the panic was past! The color, too, was unique,
in my experience; a gold as vivid as auburn. Or
was it tinged with auburn? As I leaned forward
to catch the candle-light, a drift of that fragrance
worn by my visitor floated from her braid.</p>

<p>At once I knew what had changed in the room.
The air that had been so pure when the house was
opened, now was heavy with an odor of damp and
mould that had seeped into the atmosphere as moisture
will seep through cellar walls. One would have
said that the door of some hideous vault had been
opened into my bedchamber. This stench struggled,
as it were, with the volatile perfume that clung about
the braid; so that my senses were thrust back and
forth between disgust and delight in the strangest
wavering of sensation.</p>

<p>I made the strongest effort to put away the effect
this wavering had upon me. I forced myself to sit
still and think of normal things; of the men whom
I was to see next morning, of the plans I meant to
discuss with them.</p>

<p>Useless! The stench was making me ill. A
wave of giddiness swept over me, and passed. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
heart was beating slowly and heavily. Something in
my head pulsed in unison. I felt a frightful depression,
that suddenly burst into an attack of fear gripping
me like hysteria. I wanted to shriek aloud like
a woman, to cover my eyes and run blindly. But
at the same time my muscles failed me. Will and
strength were arrested like frozen water.</p>

<p>As I sat there, facing the door of the room, I
became aware of Something at the window behind
my back. Something that pressed against the open
window and stared at me with a hideous covetousness
beside which the greed of a beast for its prey
is a natural, innocent appetite. I felt that Thing's
hungry malignance like a soft, dreadful mouth sucking
toward me, yet held away from me by some force
vaguely based on my own resistance. And I understood
how a man may die of horror.</p>

<p>Yet, presently, I turned around. Weak and sick,
with dragging effort I turned in my chair and faced
the black, uncurtained window where I felt It to be.</p>

<p>Nothing was there, to sight or hearing. I sat
still, and combated that which I knew <i>was</i> there.
In the profound stillness, I heard the wind stir the
naked branches of the trees, the flowing water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
through the fragments of the one-time dam, the
sputtering of my candle which needed trimming.
Sweat ran down my face and body, drenching me
with cold. It crouched against the empty window,
staring at me.</p>

<p>After a time, the presence seemed not so close.
At last, I seemed to know It was gone. In the gush
of that enormous relief my remaining strength was
swept away like a swimmer in a torrent and I collapsed
half-fainting in my chair.</p>

<p>When I was able, I rose and walked through the
house again. Again the rooms showed nothing to
my flashlight except dull furniture, walls peeling
here and there from long neglect, pictures of no
merit and dreary subject. I had expected nothing,
and I found nothing.</p>

<p>It was on my way upstairs to my bedroom that
a sentence from the invisible lady's story came back
to my mind.</p>

<p>"What crouches behind her, unseen? The
Horror takes Its own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bedroom door opened quietly under my
hand. The rain had ceased and a freshening breeze
came from the west, filling the room with sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
country air. The candle had burned down. While
I stood there, the flame flickered out.</p>

<p>After a brief indecision, I made my way to the
bed, rolled myself in the blankets, and laid down
between the four pineapple-topped posts. This time
I kept the flashlight at my hand. But almost at once
I slept, and slept heavily far into a bright, windy
March morning.</p>

<p>On the second day after my return to New
York, my Aunt Caroline Knox called me up on
the telephone.</p>

<p>There are reasons why I always feel myself at a
disadvantage with Aunt Caroline. The first of
these brings me to a trifling matter that I should
have set down before, but which I have made a habit
of ignoring so far as possible in both thought and
speech. As was Lord Byron, I am slightly lame.
I admit that is the only quality in common; still, I
like the romantic association. Now, my limp is very
slight, and I never have found it interfered much
with things I cared to do. In fact, I am otherwise
somewhat above the average in strength and vigor.
But from my boyhood Aunt Caroline always made
a point of alluding to the physical fact as often
as possible. She considered that course a healthful
discipline.</p>

<p>"My nephew," she was accustomed to introduce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
me. "Lame since he was seven. Roger, do not
scowl! Yes; run over trying to save a pet dog. A
mongrel of no value whatever!"</p>

<p>Which would have left some doubt as to whether
she referred to poor Tatters or to me, had it not been
for her exceeding pride in our family tree.</p>

<p>The second reason for my disadvantage before
her, was her utter contempt for my profession as a
composer of popular music.</p>

<p>Today her voice came thinly to me across the
long-distance wire.</p>

<p>"Your Cousin Phillida has failed in her examinations
again," she announced to me, with a species
of tragic repose. "In view of her father's intellect
and my&mdash;er&mdash;my family's, her mental status is
inexplicable. Although, of course, there is your
own case!"</p>

<p>"Why, she is the most educated girl I know," I
protested hastily.</p>

<p>"I presume you mean best educated, Roger.
Pray do not quite lose your command of language."</p>

<p>I meant exactly what I had said. Phillida has
studied since she was three years old, exhaustively
and exhaustedly. A vision of her plain, pale little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
face rose before me when I spoke. It is a burden
to be the only child of a professor, particularly for a
meek girl.</p>

<p>"She has studied insufficiently," Aunt Caroline
pursued. "She is nineteen, and her position at
Vassar is deplorable."</p>

<p>"Her health&mdash;&mdash;" I murmured.</p>

<p>"Would not have hampered her had she given
proper attention to athletics! However, I did not
call up to hear you defend Phillida in a matter of
which you are necessarily ignorant. Her father and
I are somewhat better judges, I should suppose, than
a young man who is not a student in any true sense
of the word and ignores knowledge as a purpose in
life. Not that I wish to wound or depreciate you,
Roger. There is, I may say, a steadiness of moral
character beneath your frivolity of mind and pursuit.
If my poor brother had trained you more wisely; if
you had been <i>my</i> son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Aunt," I acknowledged the benevolent
intention, with an inward quailing at the clank
of fetters suggested. "Was there something I can
do for you?"</p>

<p>"Will you meet Phillida at the Grand Central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and bring her home? I cannot have her cross New
York alone and take a second train out here. Her
father has a lecture this afternoon and I have a club
meeting at the house."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Aunt! What time does her
train get in?"</p>

<p>"Half after four. Thank you, Roger. And,
she looks on you as an elder brother. I believe an
attitude of cool disapproval on your part might
impress upon her how she has disappointed
the family."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, Aunt. May I take her to tea,
between trains, and get out to your place on the six
o'clock express?"</p>

<p>"If you think best. You might advise her
seriously over the tea."</p>

<p>"A dash of lemon, as it were," I reflected.
"Certainly, Aunt, I could."</p>

<p>"Very well. I am really obliged!"</p>

<p>"The pleasure is mine, Aunt."</p>

<p>But that it was going to be Phillida's, I had
already decided. She would need the support of tea
and French pastry before facing her home. As for
treating her with cool disapproval, I would sooner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
have spent a year at Vassar myself. It was my intention
to meet her with a box of chocolates instead of
advice. Phil was not allowed candy, her complexion
being under cultivation. On the occasions when
we were out together it had been my custom to
provide a box of sweets, upon which she browsed
luxuriously, bestowing the remnants upon some
street child before reaching her home.</p>

<p>From the telephone I turned back to that frivolous
pursuit of which my aunt had spoken with
such tactfully veiled contempt. She was not softened
by the respectable fortune I had made from
several successful musical comedies and a number of
efforts which my publishers advertise as "high-class
parlor pieces for the home." In fact, she felt it to be
a grievance that my lightness should be better paid
than the Professor's learning. In which she was
no doubt right!</p>

<p>Ever since my return from my newly purchased
farm in Connecticut, however, I had not been working
for money or popular approval, but for my own
pleasure. There was a Work upon which I spent
only special hours of delicious leisure and infinite
labor. It held all that was forbidden to popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
compositions; depth and sorrow and dissonances
dearer than harmony. I called it a Symphony Polynesian,
and I had spent years in study of barbaric
music, instruments and kindred things that this love-child
of mine might be more richly clothed by a tone
or a fancy. Aunt Caroline had interrupted, this
morning, at a very point of achievement toward
which I had been working through the usual alternations
of enjoyment and exasperation, elevation and
dejection that attend most workmen. Pausing only
to set my alarm-clock, I hurried into recording what
I had found, in the tangible form of paper and ink.</p>

<p>I always set the alarm-clock when I have an
engagement, warned by dire experiences.</p>

<p>Aunt Caroline had summoned me about eleven in
the morning. When the strident voice of the clock
again aroused me, I had just time to dress and reach
the Grand Central by half-past four. I recognized
that I was hungry, that the vicinity was snowed over
with sheets of paper, that the piano keys had acquired
another inkstain, and my pipe had charred another
black spot on the desk top. Well, it had been a good
day; and Phillida's tea would have to be my belated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
luncheon or early dinner. Even so, it was necessary
to make haste.</p>

<p>It was in that haste of making ready that I uncovered
the braid of glittering hair which I had
brought from Connecticut. I use no exaggeration
when I say it glittered. It did; each hair was lustrous
with a peculiar, shining vitality, and crinkled slightly
along its full length. With a renewed self-reproach
at sight of its humbled exile and captivity, I took up
the trophy of my one adventure. While I am without
much experience, such a quantity seemed unusual.
Also, I had not known such a mass of hair could be
so soft and supple in the hand. My mother and little
sister died before I can remember; and while I have
many good friends, I have none intimate enough to
educate me in such matters. Perhaps a consciousness
of that trifling physical disadvantage of mine has
made me prefer a good deal of solitude in my hours
at home.</p>

<p>The faint, tenacious yet volatile perfume drifted
to my nostrils, as I held the braid. Who could the
woman be who brought that costly fragrance into a
deserted farmhouse? For so exquisite and unique a
fragrance could only be the work of a master per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>fumer.
There was youth in that vigorous hair,
coquetry in the individual perfume, panic in her useless
sacrifice of the braid I held; yet strangest self-possession
in the telling of that fanciful tale of
sorcery to me.</p>

<p>On that tale, told dramatically in the dark, I had
next morning blamed the weird waking nightmare
that I had suffered after her visit. The horror of
the night could not endure the strong sun and wind
of the March morning that followed. Like <i>Scrooge</i>,
I analyzed my ghost as a bit of undigested beef or
a blot of mustard. Certainly the thing had been
actual enough while it lasted, but my reason had
thrust it away. That was over, I reflected, as I laid
the braid back in the drawer. But surely the lady
was not vanished like the nightmare? Surely I
should find her in some neighbor's daughter, when
my house was finished and I went there for the
summer? She could not hide from me, with that
bright web about her head whose twin web I held.</p>

<p>It had grown so late that I had to take a taxicab
to the Terminal, just halting at a shop long enough
to buy a box of the chocolates my cousin preferred.
But when I reached the great station and found my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
way through the swirl of travelers to the track
where Phil's train should come in, I was told the
express had been delayed.</p>

<p>"Probably half an hour late," the gateman informed
me. "Maybe more! Of course, though, she
may pull in any time."</p>

<p>Which meant no tea for Phillida; instead, a rush
across town to the Pennsylvania station to catch the
train for her home. As I could not leave my post
lest she arrive in my absence, it also meant nothing
to eat for me until we reached Aunt Caroline's hospitality;
which was cool and restrained rather
than festive.</p>

<p>I foresaw the heavy atmosphere that would brood
over all like a cold fog, this evening of Phil's disgraceful
return from the scholastic arena. Ascertaining
from the gateman that the erring train was
certain not to pull in during the next ten minutes, I
sought a telephone booth.</p>

<p>"Aunt Caroline, Phil's train is going to be very
late, possibly an hour late," I misinformed my kinswoman,
when her voice answered me. "I have had
nothing to eat since breakfast, and she will be hungry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
long before we reach your house. May I not take her
to dinner here in town?"</p>

<p>"Please do not call your cousin 'Phil'," she
rebuked me, and paused to deliberate. "You had
no luncheon, you say?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Why not? Were you ill?"</p>

<p>"No; just busy. I forgot lunch. I am beginning
to feel it, now. Still, if you wish us to come
straight home, do not consider me!"</p>

<p>I knew of old how submission mollified Aunt
Caroline. She relented, now.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;! You are very good, Roger, to save
your uncle a trip into the city to meet her. I must
not impose upon you. But, a quiet hotel!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Aunt."</p>

<p>"Phillida does not deserve pampering enjoyment.
I am consenting for your sake."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Aunt. I wonder, then, if you
would mind if we stopped to see a show that I especially
want to look over, for business reasons? We
could come out on the theatre express; as we have
done before, you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>"Thank you. I'll take good care of her.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>The receiver was still talking when I hung up.
There is no other form of conversation so incomparably
convenient.</p>

<p>The train arrived within the half-hour. With
the inrush of travelers, I sighted Phillida's sober
young figure moving along the cement platform.
She walked with dejection. Her gray suit represented
a compromise between fashion and her
mother's opinion of decorum, thus attaining a length
and fulness not enough for grace yet too much for
jauntiness. Her solemn gray hat was set too squarely
upon the pale-brown hair, brushed back from her
forehead. Her nice, young-girl's eyes looked out
through a pair of shell-rimmed spectacles. She was
too thin and too pale to content me.</p>

<p>When she saw me coming toward her, her face
brightened and colored quite warmly. She waved
her bag with actual abandon and her lagging step
quickened to a run.</p>

<p>"Cousin Roger!" she exclaimed breathlessly.
"Oh, how good of you to come!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>She gripped my hands in a candid fervor of relief
and pleasure.</p>

<p>"I am so glad it is you," she insisted. "I was
sorry the train could not be later; I wished, almost,
it would never get in&mdash;and all the time it was you who
were waiting for me!"</p>

<p>"It was, and now you are about to share an
orgy," I told her. "I have your mother's permission
to take you to dinner, Miss Knox."</p>

<p>"Here? In town? Just us?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And afterward we will take in any show
you fancy. How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>She gazed up at me, absorbing the idea and my
seriousness. To my dismay, she grew pale again.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really believe it will keep me from
just dying."</p>

<p>I pretended to think that a joke. But I recognized
that my little cousin was on the sloping way
toward a nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>"No baggage?" I observed. "Good! I hope
you did not eat too much luncheon. This will be an
early dinner."</p>

<p>She waited to take off the spectacles and put them
in her little bag.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>"I do not need them except to study, but I didn't
dare meet Mother without them," she explained.
"No; I could not eat lunch, or breakfast either,
Cousin Roger. Nor much dinner last night! Oh,
if you knew how I dread&mdash;the grind! I should
rather run away."</p>

<p>"So we will; for this evening."</p>

<p>"Yes. Where&mdash;where were you going to
take me?"</p>

<p>We had crossed the great white hall to street
level, and a taxicab was rolling up to halt before us.
Surprised by the anxiety in the eyes she lifted to
mine, I named the staid, quietly fastidious hotel
where I usually took her when we were permitted an
excursion together.</p>

<p>"Unless you have a choice?" I finished.</p>

<p>"I have." She breathed resolution. "I want to
go to a restaurant with a cabaret, instead of going
to the theatre. May I? Please, may I? Will you
take me where I say, this one time?"</p>

<p>Her earnestness amazed me. I knew what her
mother would say. I also knew, or thought I knew
that Phillida needed the mental relaxation which
comes from having one's own way. In her mood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
no one else's way, however, wise or agreeable, will
do it all.</p>

<p>"All right," I yielded. "If you will promise me,
faith of a gentlewoman, to tell Aunt Caroline that I
took you there and you did not know where you were
going. My shoulders are broader than yours and
have borne the buffeting of thirty-two years instead
of nineteen. Had you chosen the place, or shall I?"</p>

<p>To my second surprise, she answered with the
name of an uptown place where I never had been,
and where I would have decidedly preferred not
to take her.</p>

<p>"They have a skating ballet," she urged, as I
hesitated. "I know it is wonderful! Please,
please&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I gave the direction to the chauffeur and followed
my cousin into the cab. It seemed a proper moment
to present the chocolates from my overcoat pocket.
When she proved too languid to unwrap the box, I
was seriously uneasy.</p>

<p>"You cannot possibly know how dreadful it is
to be the only child of two intellectual people who
expect one to be a credit," she excused her lack of
appetite, nervously twitching the gilt cord about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
package. "And to be stupid and a disappointment!
Yes, as long as I can remember, I have been a disappointment.
If only there had been another to
divide all those expectations. If only you had been
my brother!"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" I exclaimed hastily. "That
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't bother about explaining," she smiled
wanly, "I understand. But you are distinguished,
and you look it. I never will be, and I am ugly.
Mother expects me to be an astronomer like Father
and work with him, or to go in for club life and
serious writing as she does. I never can do either."</p>

<p>"Neither could I, Phil."</p>

<p>"You are clever, successful. Everybody knows
your name. When we are out, and people or an
orchestra play your music, Mother always says: 'A
trifle of my nephew's, Roger Locke. Very original,
is it not? Of course, I do not understand music,
but I hear that his last light opera&mdash;&mdash;' And then
she leans back and just <i>eats up</i> all the nice things
said about your work. She would never let you
know it, but she does. And that is the sort of thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
she wants from me. I&mdash;I want to make cookies,
and I love fancywork."</p>

<p>The taxicab drew up with a jerk before the
gaudy entrance to Silver Aisles.</p>

<p>I imagine Phillida had the vaguest ideas of what
such places were like. When we were settled at a
table in a general blaze of pink lights, beside a fountain
that ran colored water, I regarded her humorously.
But she seemed quite contented with her
surroundings, looking about her with an air I can best
describe as grave excitement. At this hour, the
room was not half filled, and the jazz orchestra had
withdrawn to prepare for a hard night's work.</p>

<p>After I had ordered our dinner, I glanced up to
see her fingers busied loosening the severe lines of
her brushed back hair.</p>

<p>"Everyone here looks so nice," she said wistfully.
"I wish my hair did shine and cuddle around
my face like those women's does. Do&mdash;do I look
queer, Cousin? You are looking at me so&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking what pretty eyes you have."</p>

<p>Her pale face flushed.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Most truthfully. As for the hair, isn't that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
matter of bottled polish and hairdressers? But you
remind me of a question for you. Isn't a braid of
hair this wide," I laid off the dimensions on the
table, "this long, and thick, a good deal for a woman
to own?"</p>

<p>"Show me again."</p>

<p>I obeyed, while she leaned forward to observe.</p>

<p>"Not one girl in a hundred has so much," she
pronounced judgment. "Who is she? Probably it
isn't all her own, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"It is not now, but it was," I said remorsefully.</p>

<p>"How could you tell? Did you measure it?"&mdash;with
sarcasm. "Do you remember the maxim we
used to write in copybooks? 'Measure a thousand
times, and cut once?' One has to be cautious!"</p>

<p>"I cut it first, and then measured."</p>

<p>"What? Tell me."</p>

<p>At last she was interested and amused. There
was no reason why I should not tell her of my midnight
adventure. We never repeated one another's
little confidences.</p>

<p>She listened, with many comments and exclamations,
to the story of the unseen lady, the legend of
the fair witch, the dagger that was a paper-knife by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
day and the severed tresses. She did not hear of the
singular nightmare or hallucination that had been my
second visitor. My reason had accounted for the
experience and dismissed it. Some other part of
myself avoided the memory with that deep, unreasoning
sense of horror sometimes left by a
morbid dream.</p>

<p>The dinner crowd had flowed in while we ate
and talked. A burst of applause aroused me to this
fact and the commencement of the first show of the
evening. The orchestra had taken their places.</p>

<p>"They will hardly begin with their best act," I
remarked, surprised by Phillida's convulsive start
and rapt intentness upon the stretch of ice that
formed the exhibition floor. "Your ballet on skates
probably will come later."</p>

<p>"I did not come to see the ballet," she answered,
her voice low.</p>

<p>"No? What, then?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;man I know?"</p>

<p>Once when I was a little fellow, I raced headlong
into the low-swinging branch of a tree, the bough
striking me across the forehead so that I was bowled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
over backward amid a shower of apples. I felt a
twin sensation, now.</p>

<p>"Here, Phillida?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Someone from your home town or your college
town?" I essayed a casual tone.</p>

<p>"Neither. He belongs here, and they call him
Flying Vere. He&mdash;Look! Look, Cousin!"</p>

<p>I turned, and saw that the first performer was
upon the ice floor.</p>

<p>He came down the center like a silver-shod Mercury.
In the silence, for the orchestra did not accompany
his entrance, the faint musical ringing of his
skates ran softly with him. My first unwilling
recognition of his good looks and athletic grace was
followed by an equally reluctant admission of his
skill. Reluctant, because my anger and bewilderment
were hot against the man. My little cousin, my
pathetic, unworldly Phillida&mdash;and this cabaret entertainer!
At the mere joining of their names my senses
revolted. What could they have in common? How
had she seen him? Having seen him, it was easy to
understand how he had fascinated her inexperience.
Only, what was his object?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>He had seen us, where we sat. I saw his dark
eyes fix upon her and flash some message. Her
plain little face irradiated, her fingers unconsciously
twisting and wringing her napkin, she leaned forward
to watch and answer glance for glance.</p>

<p>I would rather not put into words my thoughts.
Yet, I watched his performance. In spite of myself,
he held me with his swift, certain skill, his vitality
and youth.</p>

<p>He was gone, with the swooping suddenness of
his appearance. The jazz music clattered out.
Phillida turned back to me and began to speak with
a hushed rapture that baffled and infuriated me.</p>

<p>"You understand, Cousin Roger? Now that
you have seen him, you do understand? No! Let
me talk, please. Let me tell you, if I can. It began
last summer, at the school where I was cramming for
college work. Oh, how tired I was of study! How
tired of it I am, and always shall be! I think that
side of me never will get rested. Then, in the
woods, I met him. He was stopping at a hotel not
far away. I&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I waited for her to go on. Instead, she abruptly
spread wide her hands in a gesture of helplessness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>"After all, I cannot tell you. Not even you,
Cousin! He&mdash;he liked me. He treated me just as
a really, truly girl who would have partners at dances
and wear fluffy frocks and curl her hair. He thought
I was pretty!"</p>

<p>The na&iuml;ve wonder and triumph of her cry, the
challenge in her brown eyes, to my belief, were moving
things. I registered some ugly mental comments
on the rearing of Phil and the kind of humility that
is <i>not</i> good for the soul.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I demanded. "Of course!"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No. Thank you, but&mdash;no! Not pretty, except
to him. Only to him, because he loves me."</p>

<p>I do not know what impatience I exclaimed. She
checked me, leaning across the table to grasp my hand
in both hers.</p>

<p>"Hush! Oh, hush, dear Cousin Roger! For it
is quite too late. We were married six months ago;
last autumn."</p>

<p>When I could, I asked:</p>

<p>"Married legally, beyond mistake? Were you
not under eighteen years old?"</p>

<p>"I was eighteen years and a half. There is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
mistake at all. We walked over to the city hall in
the nearest town, and took out our license, and
were married."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will take you home to your
father and mother, now; then see this man, myself.
If there is indeed no flaw in the marriage and it
cannot be annulled, a divorce must be arranged. Any
money I have or expect to have would be a small
price to set you free from the miserable business.
But the first thing is to get you home. We will
start now."</p>

<p>She detained my hand when I would have signalled
our waiter. Her eyes, shining and solemn
as a small child's, met mine.</p>

<p>"No, Cousin, please! I am not going home any
more. At least, not alone. I asked you to bring
me here where he is, because I am going to stay
with my husband."</p>

<p>"Never," I stated firmly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not if I have to send for your father and take
you home by force."</p>

<p>"You cannot. I am of age."</p>

<p>"Phillida, I am responsible for you to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
parents tonight. Let me take you home, explain
things to them, and then decide your course."</p>

<p>"But that is what I most do not want to do!"
she na&iuml;vely exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You will not?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. No."</p>

<p>"Then I must see the man."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;hurt&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I recalled the man we had just seen on the skating
floor, with a qualm of quite unreasonable bitterness.
That anxiety of Phillida's had a flavor of irony
for me.</p>

<p>"Hardly," I returned. "There are fortunately
other means of persuasion than physical force."</p>

<p>"Oh! But you cannot persuade him to give
me up."</p>

<p>I was silent. At which, being a woman, she
grew troubled.</p>

<p>"How could you?" she urged.</p>

<p>"You have had no opportunity of judging what
influence money has on some people, Phil."</p>

<p>She laughed out in relief.</p>

<p>"Is that all? Try, Cousin."</p>

<p>"You trust him so much?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>"In everything, forever!"</p>

<p>"Then if I succeed in buying him off, promise
me that you will come home with me."</p>

<p>"If he takes money to leave me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I should die. But I will promise if you want
me to, because I know it never will happen. Just
as I might promise to do anything, when I knew that
I never would have to carry it out."</p>

<p>"Very well," I accepted the best I could get.
"I will go find him."</p>

<p>"There is no need. He is coming here to our
table as soon as he is free."</p>

<p>"I will not have you seen with him in this place."</p>

<p>"But I am going to stay here with him," she said.</p>

<p>Her eyes, the meek eyes of Phillida, defied me.
My faint authority was a sham. What could be
done, I recognized, must be done through the man.</p>

<p>We sat in silence, after that. Presently, her gaze
fixed aslant on me as if to dare my interference, she
drew up a thin gold chain that hung about her neck
and ended beneath her blouse. From it she unfastened
a wedding ring and gravely put the thing on
her third finger, the school-girl romanticism of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
gesture blended with an air of little-girl naughtiness.
She looked more fit for a nursery than for
this business.</p>

<p>I could tell from the change in her expression
when the man was approaching. I rose, meaning
to meet him and turn him aside from our table. But
Phillida halted me with one deftly planted question.</p>

<p>"You would not leave me alone in this place,
Cousin?"</p>

<p>Certainly I would not leave her alone at a table
here; not even alone in appearance while I had my
interview with the man close at hand. Yet it
seemed impossible to speak before her. She calmly
answered my perplexity.</p>

<p>"You must talk to him here, of course. I&mdash;want
to listen to you both. Indeed, I shall not interfere
at all, or be angry or hurt! I know how good you
mean to be, dear; only, you do not understand."</p>

<p>I sat down again, perforce. When the man's
shadow presently fell across our table, it did not
soothe me to see Phil thrust her hand in his, her
small face enraptured, her fingers locking about his
with a caress plain as a kiss. She said proudly,
if tremulously:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>"Cousin Roger, this is my husband. Mr. Locke,
Ethan dear."</p>

<p>He said nothing. His hesitating movement to
offer his hand I chose to ignore. I admit that my
spirit rose against him to the point of loathing as
he stood there, tall, correct in attire&mdash;the focus of
admiring glances from other diners&mdash;in every way
the antithesis of my poor Phillida.</p>

<p>"Sit down," I bade curtly, when he did not
speak. "Miss Knox insists that we have our interview
here. I should have preferred otherwise, but
her presence must not prevent what has to be said."</p>

<p>"It won't prevent anything I want to say, Mr.
Locke," he answered.</p>

<p>He spoke with a drawl. Not the drawl of affectation,
nor the drawl of South or West so cherished
by the romantic, but the slow, deliberate speech of
New England's upper coasts. It had the oddest
effect, that honest, homely accent on the lips of a
performer in this place. Phil drew him down to the
third chair at the table. After which, she folded
her hands on the edge of the cloth as if to signify to
me how she kept her promise of neutrality, and
looked fixedly at her glass of water instead of at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
either of us. Plainly, all action was supposed to
proceed from me.</p>

<p>"My cousin has just told me of her marriage," I
opened, as dryly concise as I could manage explanation.
"It is of course impossible that she should
adopt your way of living, as she seems to have in
mind. You may not understand, yet, that it also is
impossible for you to adopt hers. No doubt you
have supposed her to be the daughter of wealthy
people, or at least people of whom money could be
obtained. You were wrong. Professor Knox has
nothing but his modest salary. Her parents are of
the scholarly, not of the moneyed class. She has
no kin who could or would support her husband or
pay largely to be rid of him. Of all her people, I
happen to be the best off, financially. It happens also
that I am not sentimental, nor alarmed at the idea of
newspaper exploitation for either of us. It is necessary
that all this be plainly set forth before we
go further.</p>

<p>"Now, for your side: you have involved Miss
Knox to the extent of marriage. To free her from
this trap into which her inexperience has walked is
worth a reasonable price. I will pay it. I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
take her home to her father and mother tonight, and
consult my lawyer tomorrow. He will conduct
negotiations with you. The day Miss Knox is
divorced from you without useless scandal or trouble-making,
I will pay to you the sum agreed upon with
my lawyer. If you prefer to make yourself objectionable,
you will get nothing, now or later."</p>

<p>He took it all without a flicker of the eyelids, not
interrupting or displaying any affectation of being
insulted. I acknowledge, now, that it was an outrageous
speech to make to a man of whom I knew
nothing. But it was so intended; summing up what
I considered an outrageous situation brought about
by his playing upon a young girl's ignorance of such
fellows as himself. Phillida's usually pale cheeks
were burning. Several times she would have broken
in upon me with protests, if Vere had not silenced her
by the merest glances of warning. A proof of his
influence over her which had not inclined me toward
gentleness with him!</p>

<p>When I finished there was a pause before he
turned his dark eyes to mine, and held them there.</p>

<p>"Honest enough!" he drawled, with that incongruous
coast-of-Maine tang to his leisureliness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"I'll match you there, Mr. Locke. I don't care
whether you make fifty thousand a year with your
music writing, or whether you grind a street-piano
with a tin-cup on top. It's nothing to me. I guess
we can do without your lawyer, too. Because, you
see, I married Mrs. Vere because I wanted her; and
I figure on supporting her. If her folks are too
cultivated to stand me, I'm sorry. But they won't
have to see me. So that's settled!"</p>

<p>He was honest. His glance drove that fact home
to me with a fist-like impact. There was nothing I
was so poorly prepared to meet.</p>

<p>Phillida's hands went out to him in an impulsive
movement. He covered them both with one of his
for a moment before gently putting them in her lap
with a gesture of reminder toward the revellers all
about us. The delicacy of that thought for her was
another disclosure of character, unconsciously made.
Worthy or unworthy, he did love Phil.</p>

<p>I am not too dully obstinate to recognize a mistake
of my own. Whatever my bitterness against
the man, I had to accord him some respect. I sat
for a while striving to align my forces to attack
this new front.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"I don't blame you for thinking what you said,
Mr. Locke," his voice presently spoke across my perplexity.
"I can see the way things came to you;
finding me here, and all! I'm glad to have had this
chance to talk it out with one of my wife's relations.
I'd like them to know she'll be taken care of. Outside
of that, I guess there is nothing we have to say
to each other."</p>

<p>"I suppose I owe you both an apology," I
said stiffly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right&mdash;for both of us! I can see
how much store you set by her."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do with her, man?"
I burst forth. "Do you expect to keep her here;
sitting at a table in this place and watching you do
your turn, making your fellow performers her
friends, seeing and learning&mdash;&mdash;?" I checked my
outpouring of disgust. "Or do you propose to shut
her up in some third-class boarding house day and
night while you hang around here? Good heavens,
Vere, do you realize what either life would be for an
nineteen-year-old girl brought up as she has been?"</p>

<p>He colored.</p>

<p>"As for bringing up," he retorted, "I guess she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
couldn't be a lot more miserable than her folks worried
her into being. But&mdash;you're right about the
rest. That's why I was going to leave her with her
folks yet a while, until I had a place for her. I
mean, while I saved up enough to get the place."</p>

<p>"But I wrote to him when I failed in my exams,
Cousin Roger," Phillida broke in. "I told him that
I would not go home. I could not bear it. I was
coming to him, and he would just have to keep me
with him or I should <i>die</i>. Indeed, I do not care about
places. I think it will be lovely fun to sit here and
watch him, or go behind the scenes with him and
make friends with the other people. I&mdash;I am surprised
that you are so narrow, Cousin Roger, when
all your own best friends are theatrical people and
artists and you think so highly of them."</p>

<p>I answered nothing to that. The distance between
the stage and this class of cabaret show was
not to be traversed in a few seven-league words. I
looked at Vere, who returned my look squarely
and soberly.</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about her being here, Mr.
Locke," he said. "I know better than that! But
she has to come to me; it's her right, don't you think?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
I'll promise you to take her to a better place as soon
as I can manage."</p>

<p>"What kind of a place?"</p>

<p>"I'm saving to get a place in the country," he
answered diffidently. "I'm a countryman, and
Phillida thinks she'd like it."</p>

<p>"You?" I exclaimed, unable to smother my
derision and unbelief. My glance summed up his
fastidious apparel and grooming, the gloss on his
curling dark hair and the dubious diamond on his
little finger.</p>

<p>He reddened through his clear, dark skin, but his
eyes were not those of a man taken in a lie.</p>

<p>"Did you take notice of what I do here?" He
asked me, with the first touch of humility I had seen
in him. "I couldn't dance or sing or do parlor tricks.
I wasn't bred to parlors or indoors. But I learned
to skate pretty fancy from a boy up. My folks' farm
was on one side of a lake and the schoolhouse on
the other. About November that lake used to freeze
solid. My brother and I used to skate five miles to
school, and back again, before we were six years old.
We lived on skates about half the year, I guess.
Well&mdash;you don't care about the rest; how the farm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
was just about big enough to support my elder brother
and his family, and I came to New York. Nor how
I found New York pretty well filled up with folks
who knew considerably more than I did. It was
the manager of this place who advertised for expert
skaters, who dressed me up like this, and paid me the
first living wages I'd had in the city. All the same,
I was bred a farmer, and I mean to get back to it.
Always have! You're a man, Mr. Locke, and I'd
hate you to think I was a shimmy dancer on ice and
nothing else, or I wouldn't mention it. My father
would have taken the buggy-whip to me, I guess, if
he'd lived to see me in this rig. Soon as I've enough
put by, I'll shed this perfumed suit and the cheap
jewelry and take my wife where she can have a chance
to forget I ever wore them."</p>

<p>"But I <i>like</i> them," put in Phillida ardently.
"Please do not fuss so, Ethan; because I really do."</p>

<p>"Do you?" I turned upon her. "Are you sure,
then, that it is not all this cabaret glamour you really
are in love with? Would you care for him as an ordinary,
hard-working fellow in a pair of overalls and
a flannel shirt? No applause, no lights, no stage?"</p>

<p>She laughed up at me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>"You have forgotten that I met Ethan while he
was on a vacation from his work here, and roughing
it. When I married him, I had hardly seen him in
anything except his Navy flannel shirt, scrubby
trousers, and funny blunt-toed shoes."</p>

<p>"You served in the war?" I asked him.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. On a submarine chaser. Got pneumonia
from exposure and was invalided home just before
the Armistice."</p>

<p>"And you came back here?"</p>

<p>"I came here," he corrected me. "I enlisted
from Maine. I was discharged in New York. That
was when I couldn't find anything I could do, until
this skating trick came along."</p>

<p>I sat thinking for a time; as long thoughts as I
could command. The obvious course was to send for
Phillida's father. Yet what could that vague and
learned gentleman do that I could not? I visioned
the Professor standing in this riotous, gaudy restaurant,
swinging his eye-glasses by their silk ribbon
and peering at Vere in helpless distaste and consternation.
It was practically certain that Phil would
refuse to go home with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>What if she did go home? I could picture the
scene there, when the truth came out. The mortification
of her people, the gossip in the little town,
her outcast position among the girls and boys with
whom she had grown up&mdash;what a martyrdom for
a sensitive spirit! Of course, the only possible
thing considered by Aunt Caroline would be a
prompt divorce.</p>

<p>If Phillida refused to consent to a divorce, how
could she live at home as the wife of a man her
parents had pronounced unfit to receive? If she
yielded and gave up Vere, would she be much better
off? An embarrassment to her family, the heroine
of a stolen marriage and Reno freedom, what chance
of happiness would she have in her conventional
circle? Especially as she neither was a beauty nor
the dashing type of girl who might make capital of
such a reputation. Probably she would bury herself
in nunlike seclusion, stay in her room when callers
came, and wear a veil when she went out to walk.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she would break her heart for Vere.</p>

<p>Could matters be any worse if she tried life with
him, even if the experiment eventually proved a

there? Might not her parents be spared much they
most dreaded, if their friends could be told simply
that Phillida had made a love match and was with
her husband?</p>

<p>Finally, Phillida was a human creature with the
right to manage her own life. Had any of us the
right to lay hands upon her existence and mould it
to our fancy?</p>

<p>I looked up from my revery to find the eyes of
both of them fixed on me as if I held their doom
balanced upon my palm. Perhaps, in a sense, I did.</p>

<p>"Phil, will you come home to your father and
mother, and consider all this a bit more before you
decide?" I asked her.</p>

<p>I thought I knew the answer to this, and I did.</p>

<p>"No, Cousin Roger," she refused firmly.
"Please forgive me. I know how kind you mean
to be, but&mdash;no! I shall stay with Ethan. If ever you
love anyone, you will understand."</p>

<p>I accepted the decision. There was no reason
why I should think of the woman who had spoken to
me across the darkness in a voice of melody and
power, or why I should seem to feel again the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>quisite,
live softness of her braid within my hand.
But it was so.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "Vere, it is to you, then,
as Phillida's husband, that I must address any plans.
I do not pretend to like the course she has taken. I
do not know what action her parents may take,
although I believe they will listen to my advice.
Putting all that aside, she refuses to come with me
and you agree that she cannot stay here.</p>

<p>"I have just bought a farm in Connecticut, intending
to use it as a summer home. There are some
alterations and repairs being made, but little is to be
changed inside the house and it is in perfectly livable
shape. Here is my offer. Take Phillida there, and
I will make you manager of the place. I will pay all
reasonable expenses of putting the land into proper
condition and getting such stock and equipment as
you judge best; all expenses and up-keep of the house
and whatever salary usually is drawn by such managers
of small estates. I shall be there, on and off, but
you and Phillida must take charge of everything. I
am neither a farmer nor a housekeeper, and do not
wish to be either. I bought the place only because
New York is too hot to work in during three months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of the year, and I hate summer resorts. Keep my
room ready, and you will find I disturb you little.
Of course, hire what servants are necessary.</p>

<p>"Now, if you make the place self-supporting inside
of five years, I will deed the whole thing to you
two. To put it better, if you succeed in making the
farm pay a living for yourselves, I will make it over to
you and withdraw. If you fail&mdash;well, I suppose you
will be no worse off than you are now!"</p>

<p>They were stricken speechless. Perhaps my attitude
had not pointed to such a conclusion of our interview.
Phillida told me long afterward that she expected
me to bid them good-evening and abandon
them forever, as my mildest course; with alternative
possibilities such as summoning a policeman and
having Vere haled to prison. Seeing their condition,
I rose.</p>

<p>"I will stroll about and leave you a chance to
talk it over," I declared; although there are few
ordeals I dislike more than displaying my limp about
such public rooms.</p>

<p>Vere stopped me, rising as I rose.</p>

<p>"No need of that, for us," he answered, facing
me across the little table. "About giving us your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
farm, Mr. Locke, that's for the future! Just now,
the manager's job is plenty big enough to thank you
for. I wish I could say it better. If you'll stay here
with Phillida for ten minutes, until I can get back,
I'll be obliged."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To resign here, and get my outfit into a
suitcase."</p>

<p>He had taken up my challenge like a man, at
least. There were none of the hesitations and excuses
to stay in town that I had half expected. It
pleased me that he decided for Phil as well as himself.
Some of my ideas about marriage are antiquated,
I admit. I nodded to him, and sat
down again.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to record the childish things
Phillida tried to say to me, while he was gone.</p>

<p>"I am so happy," was her apology for threatened
tears. "I never knew anyone&mdash;except Ethan&mdash;could
be so kind. And&mdash;and, will you tell Father
and Mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes." I winced, though, at that prospect.
"Give me that little bag you carry on your wrist."</p>

<p>She obeyed, wide-eyed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>"You do tote a powder-puff. I did not know
whether Aunt Caroline permitted it. Rub it on your
nose," I advised, passing the bit of fluff to her.</p>

<p>While she complied, almost like a normally frivolous
girl, I used the moment to transfer a few banknotes
to the bag, so some need might not find
her penniless.</p>

<p>Vere came back in not much more than the promised
ten minutes. He had changed to gray street
clothes and carried a suitcase. I noted that the diamond
had disappeared from his finger and his curly
head looked as if it had been held under a water-faucet
and vigorously toweled to lessen the brilliantine
gloss.</p>

<p>"If you'll tell us where your farm is, Mr.
Locke, we'll start," he volunteered.</p>

<p>Phillida looked up at him with eyes of adoring
trust.</p>

<p>"I had the porter at the Terminal check my suitcase
to be called for. We shall have to get it, dear."</p>

<p>In spite of myself, I smiled at their amazing
promptitude. There was both reassurance and
pathos in its unconscious youth. All this eagerness
pressing forward&mdash;where? They did not know, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
I. Certainly we did not dream how strange a goal
awaited one of us three, or on what weird, desolate
path that traveler's foot was already set.</p>

<p>"You had better go to a good hotel for tonight,"
I modified their plan. "Tomorrow is time enough
to go out to the farm, by daylight. Phil has had
enough excitement for one day. I will write full
directions for the trip, Vere, on the back of this
timetable of the railroad you must take."</p>

<p>They were enchanted with this suggestion. Indeed,
they were in a state of mind to have assented
if I advised them to sit out on a park bench
until morning.</p>

<p>Yet, when I had put them and their scanty luggage
into a taxicab, I suffered a bad pang of misgiving.
What responsibility was I assuming in letting
my little-girl cousin go like this? What did I
know of this man, or where he would take her? I
think Phillida divined something of my trouble, for
she leaned out the door to me and held up her face
like a child's to be kissed.</p>

<p>"I am so <i>happy</i>," she whispered.</p>

<p>I turned to Vere; who had a long envelope in
readiness to put in my hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"I guess you might like to have these for a
while, Mr. Locke," he said, with one of his slow,
straightforward glances.</p>

<p>With which farewells I had to be content, and
watch their taxi swing out into the bright-dark flow
of traffic where it was lost from my sight. After
which, I entered another taxicab by my unromantic
self and was driven to that railroad station where
I would find a train bound to the college town that
was the home of Aunt Caroline and her husband.
One always thought of Phil's parents in that order,
although the Professor was a moderately distinguished
scientist and his spouse merely masterful in
her own limited circle.</p>

<p>The envelope Vere had given me contained their
marriage certificate, his release from the Navy, and
his membership card in the American Legion.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, next morning, I was summoned
from my sleep by the bell of the telephone beside my
bed. It was not a pleasant sleep, although I had not
returned to my apartment until dawn. Nightmare
doubts galloped ruthless hoofs over any repose.</p>

<p>Phillida's voice came over the wire to me like
the morning song of a bird.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Cousin Roger. We are going
to take the train in a few moments. But I could not
leave New York without telling you how happy I
am. Are you&mdash;did I wake you up? I was afraid
that I might, but Ethan said you would like me to
call, even so."</p>

<p>"My dear, it was the kindest thought you ever
had," I told her fervently.</p>

<p>"Was it?" she hesitated. "Then&mdash;were they
pretty dreadful to you at home?"</p>

<p>"Quite!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"Do you suppose they will <i>do</i> anything dreadful
about us?"</p>

<p>"No. Nothing."</p>

<p>It did not seem necessary to tell her that Aunt
Caroline did not know where the runaways had gone,
and was thereby debarred from hasty action. Phillida's
father had privately agreed with me in this.</p>

<p>"I am so very happy, Cousin Roger!"</p>

<p>"I am glad, Phil."</p>

<p>"And you will come to the farm soon?"</p>

<p>"Soon," I promised.</p>

<p>So the nightmares of immediate anxiety for her
galloped themselves away, routed for that time. Like
my gold-fish when their bowl has been unduly shaken,
I sank down again into the quieted waters of my
little world and absorption in my own affairs. There
have been hours when I wondered if I was of more
importance than they, as a matter of cosmic fact.</p>

<p>A month passed before I kept my promise to go
to the farm in Connecticut.</p>

<p>As a first reason, I wanted to leave my young
couple alone for a period of adjustment. Also, I was
curious to see how they would handle the business
left to them. I held telephone conversations with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Phillida, and with various contractors now and then.
I sent out the furnishings for my own room. Everything
else I purposely left to the experimenters.</p>

<p>There was a second reason, more obscure. I
wanted to keep for a while the little mystery of the
lady who had come to the farmhouse room in the
dark of the night. She was pure romance, a rare
incident in a prosaic age. My table had been bare
of such delicately spiced morsels, and I relished the
savor of this one upon my palate. I was not quite
ready to find her in the matter-of-fact daughter of
some neighbor, who had sought shelter from the
storm in that supposedly empty house and probably
mistaken me for a tramp.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was equally reluctant to go back and
prove that the adventure was ended, that she had
been a bird of passage who had gone on with no
thought of return.</p>

<p>With all these delays, and the fact that my work
really kept me busy in town, April was verging
toward May when I finally saw the last of my luggage
put into the car and started on my fifty-mile
drive to the house by the lake. I did not take this
first visit very seriously, or intend it to be over long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
To be a constraint upon the household I had established,
or assume a right there, was far from the
course I planned. It was not certain Vere and I
would be comfortable housemates. But to stay
away altogether would have hurt Phillida as much
as to stay too long, I considered. Probably a week
would be about enough for this time.</p>

<p>So lightly, so ignorantly, I stepped from the first
great division of my life into the second; not hearing
the closing of the gate through which there was no
turning back.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">The Courtin'.</span><br />
</p></div>


<p>I arrived at noon, when a bright sun set the
country air afloat with motes like dust of gold. The
place seemed drenched in golden light. Even the
young grass had gold in its green, and the lake glittered
hot with yellow sparkles.</p>

<p>The house was transformed. The cream-colored
stucco that hid its homely walls, deep, arched porches
that took the place of the old shallow affairs, scarlet
Spanish tiles where bleached shingles had been&mdash;all
united in giving it the gayest, most modern air
imaginable. A gravel drive curved in beneath the
new porte-coch&egrave;re, inviting the wheels of my car to
explore. Grass had been put in order, flower-beds
laid out. The new dam was up, and the miniature
lake no longer suggested a swamp. If the place had
appealed to me in its dreary neglect, now it held out
its arms to me and laughed an invitation.</p>

<p>As I stepped from my car, I heard running feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and a girl sped around the veranda to meet me. She
cast herself into my arms before I fairly realized this
was Phillida. A Phillida as new to my eyes as the
house! After the first greetings I held her off to
analyze the change.</p>

<p>She was tanned and actually rosy. The corners
of her once sad little mouth turned up instead of
down and developed&mdash;I looked twice&mdash;yes, developed
a dimple. The dull hair I always had seen
brushed plainly back, now was parted on one side
and fluffed itself across her forehead and about her
cheeks with an astonishing effectiveness. She was
attired in a China-blue linen frock with a scarlet sash
knotted in front quite daringly, for Phillida.</p>

<p>"Why, Phil, how pretty we are!" I admired.</p>

<p>She looked up at me like a praised little girl, and
smoothed the sash. I noticed she wore above her
wedding ring that "diamond" which once had
adorned Vere's finger so distastefully to me. It
shone bravely in the sunlight with quite a display of
fire. Tracing my gaze, she held out her hand for
me to see.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was his, Cousin Roger. Of course, we
have not very much money yet, and I do not care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
about all the engagement rings that ever were
thought of. But, I was afraid people up here might
notice that I had none and think slightingly of Ethan.
So I asked him, and we went to a jeweler, who made
it smaller to fit me. It is not a false stone, you know.
It is a white topaz, and I love it better than the
biggest diamond."</p>

<p>"Then you are still happy?"</p>

<p>"Forever and ever, world without end," she
answered solemnly.</p>

<p>We went in.</p>

<p>Sun and sweet wind had worked white magic
in the long-closed house. Quaint furniture, no
longer dust-grimed but lustrous with cleanliness and
polish, had quite a different air. Fresh upholstery
in cheerful tints, fresh paper on the walls, good rugs,
order and daintiness everywhere changed the interior
out of my recognition. Already the atmosphere of
home and cheer was established.</p>

<p>"Come see your rooms," Phillida invited, enraptured
by my admiration. "They are so pretty!"</p>

<p>She ran up the stairs, around the passage, and
ushered me into the room of graceful adventure and
grotesque nightmare. I stopped on the threshold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>I had ordered the partition removed between the
two chambers on this side, giving me one large room.
This, with the little bathroom attached, occupied the
entire large frontage of the house. This long,
spacious room; floors covered by my Chinese rugs,
walls echoing the rugs' smoke-blue, my piano in a
bright corner, my special easychairs and writing-table
in their due places, welcomed me with such
familiar comfort that I could not identify the neglected
chamber where I had slept one night in the old
bed with the four pineapple-topped posts. The windows
were opened, and white curtains with their
over-draperies of blue silk were swinging in and out
on a fresh breeze where the Horror of my dream
had seemed to press itself against the black panes.
Decidedly, I must have had a bad attack of indigestion
that night!</p>

<p>"See how nice?" Phillida was urging appreciation
at my side. "We swung those lovely old hangings
from the arch, so they can be drawn across the
bedroom end of your room, if you like. Although I
do not know why you <i>should</i> like, everything is
so pretty! Your long Venetian mirror came safely,
and all your darling lamps. And&mdash;and I hope you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
like it so well, Cousin Roger, that you will stay
here always!"</p>

<p>When she left me alone, I walked to the different
windows, contemplating the stretches of lawn dotted
with budding apple trees and the lake that lay beyond
shining in the sun. Was Phillida's charming wish
to become a fact, I wondered? Could this rest
and calm hold me content here, where I had meant
merely to pause and pass on? I looked at the yellow
country road meandering past the lake into unseen
distance. Should I ever see my Lady of the Beautiful
Tresses come that way, or travel that road to where
she lived? If I did meet her, would she forgive me
the loss of her braid? There would be a test for the
sweetness of her disposition!</p>

<p>When a chiming dinner-gong summoned me
downstairs, I found Vere awaiting me beside Phillida.
We shook hands, and he made some brief, pleasant
speech about their having expected me sooner. If
pale, timid Phil had become a surprising butterfly,
Vere had taken the reverse progress toward the sober
grub. I like him better in outing clothes, although
he showed even more the unusual good looks which
so unreasonably prejudiced me against him. If he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
felt any strain in our meeting, his slow, tranquil
trick of speech and manner covered it. I hope I did
as well! It was then I discovered that his wife's
pet name for him fitted like a glove. She called
him "Drawls."</p>

<p>The luncheon was good; cooked and served by a
middle-aged Swedish woman named Cristina.
Afterward, I was conducted into the kitchen by
the lady of the house, to view the new fittings and
improvements. Most odd and pretty it was to see
Phillida in that r&ocirc;le of housewife, and to watch her
pride in Vere and deference to him. Let me record
that I never saw the daughter of Aunt Caroline fail
in this settled course toward her husband. Whether
it was born of revulsion from her mother's hectoring
domestic methods, or of consciousness that outsiders
might rate Vere below his wife in station and education,
so her respect for him must forbid their slight,
I do not know. But I never saw her oppose him or
speak rudely to him before other people. I suppose
they may have had the usual conjugal differings,
neither of them being angelic. If so, no outsider
ever glimpsed the fact.</p>

<p>We spoke of nothing serious on that first day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
They both showed me the various improvements
finished or progressing, indoors or out.</p>

<p>We dined as agreeably as we had lunched. Quite
early, afterward, I excused myself, and left together
the two who were still on their honeymoon.</p>

<p>At the door of my room, I pushed a wall-switch
that lighted simultaneously three lamps. In this I
had repeated the arrangement used by me for years
in my city apartment. I have a demand for light
somewhere in my make-up, and no reason for not
indulging it. There flashed out of the dusk a large
lamp upon my writing-table, a tall floor-lamp beside
the piano, and a reading-lamp on a stand beside my
bed at the far end of the room. All three were
shaded in a smoke-blue and rose-color effect that long
since had caught my fancy for night work; the
shades inset with imitation semi-precious stones,
rough-cut things of sapphire, tourmaline-pink and
baroque pearl.</p>

<p>I lay emphasis upon this, to make clear how
normal, serene and even familiar in effect was the
room into which I came. Yet, as I closed the door
behind me and stood in that softly brilliant radiance,
a shudder shook me from head to foot with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
violence of an electric shock. A sense of suffocation
caught at my throat like an unseen hand.</p>

<p>Both sensations were gone in the time of a drawn
breath, leaving only astonishment in their wake.
Presently I went on with the purpose that had
brought me upstairs; lifting a portfolio to the table
and beginning to unpack the work which I had been
doing in New York. As I laid out the first sheets of
music, there drifted to my ears that vague sound
from the lake I had heard on my first night visit here,
while I stood on the tumble-down porch. The sound
that was like the smack of glutinous lips, or some
creature drawing itself out of thick, viscid slime.
As before, I wondered what movement of the shallow
waters could produce that result. Not the tide, now,
for the new dam was up and the lake cut off from
Long Island Sound. The pouring of the waterfall
flowed on as a reminder of that fact.</p>

<p>The sound was not repeated. The dusk outside
the windows offered nothing unusual to
be seen. I finished my unpacking and sat down at
my writing-table.</p>

<p>I am not accustomed to heed time. There never
has been anyone to care what hours I kept, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
work best at night. Midnight was long past when I
thought of rest.</p>

<p>I declare that I thought of nothing more; not
even recalling the vague unease felt on entering the
room. A day spent in the fresh air, followed by
an evening of hard work and journeyings between
the piano and table, had left me utterly weary. When
I lay down, it was to sleep at once.</p>

</p></div>


<p>I woke slowly. It seemed that I struggled to
wakefulness as a spent swimmer struggles toward
shore. Up, up through deep poles of sleep I dragged
myself, driven by some dimly sensed necessity.
Peril had stolen upon me in my unconsciousness, a
stalking beast. I knew that with nightmare certainty.
It was as if my soul stood affrighted beside
my brain, wailing upon its ally to arouse and stand
with it against the menace. And my brain answered,
but with infinite difficulty; like a drugged
warrior who hears the clang of battle and forces
numbed limbs to stir, arise and grasp the sword.</p>

<p>I was awake. Suddenly; the swimmer reaching
the surface!</p>

<p>How shall I describe Fear incarnate? The Horror
was at the open window opposite the foot of
my bed, staring in upon me with slavering covetousness
of the prey It watched. I lay there, and felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
It seek for me across the darkness with tentacles of
evil that groped for some part of me upon which It
might lay hold.</p>

<p>The room was still. Between the draperies, the
window showed nothing to the eye except a dark
square faintly tinged with the night luminance of the
sky. There was nothing to see; nothing to hear.
But gradually I became aware of a hideous odor of
mould and mildew, of must and damp decay that
loaded the air with disgust.</p>

<p>I lay there, and opposed the approach of the
Thing with all the will of resistance in me. The
sweat poured from my whole body, so that I lay as in
water and the drenched linen of my sleeping-suit
clung coldly to me.</p>

<p>It could not pass the defense of my will. I felt
the malevolent fury of Its striving. Like the antenn&aelig;
of some monstrous insect brushing about my
body, I felt Its evil desires wavering about my mental
self, examining, searching where It might seize. It
had not yet found the weakness It sought. If
It did&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The sickening, vault-like air I must breathe
fought for It. So did the darkness. All this time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
or the time that seemed so long, I had no more command
of my body than a cataleptic patient. Every
ounce of force in me had rushed to support the two
warriors of the battle: the brain and will that opposed
the clutching menace. But now, as I grew more and
more fully awake, out of very loathing and danger
I drew determination. Slowly, painfully, I began to
free my right arm and hand from this paralysis.</p>

<p>As I advanced in resolution, the Thing seemed
to recoil. Inch by inch, I moved my hand across the
bed toward my reading-lamp on the stand beside me.
In proportion as I moved, the dreadful tentacles
drew back and away. A last effort, and the chain
was in my fingers. I jerked spasmodically.</p>

<p>Rosy light from the lamp flashed over the room.
All the quiet comfort of the place sprang into view as
if to reassure me; the piano open as I had left it, the
table strewn with my evening's work, each bit of
furniture, each drapery or trinket undisturbed.</p>

<p>The Thing was gone. In the hush I heard my
panting breath and the tick of my watch on the
stand. It was two o'clock in the morning. As I
mechanically read the hour, a cock somewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
shrilled its second call before dawn. The Horror
had been true to the legendary time of apparitions.</p>

<p>Weak and chilled, I presently made an attempt
to rise. But at the movement, a wave of sickness
swept through me. The room seemed to rock and
swing. I had just time to recognize the grip of
faintness before I fell back on the pillow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Vivifying sweetness was in my nostrils, which
expanded avidly for this new air. Perfume that was
a tonic, a subtle elixir; that sparkled upon the senses,
sank suavely and healingly through me, so that I
seemed to draw refreshment with each breath. Reluctantly,
I aroused more and more in response to
this unusual stimulant; which somehow gave delicious
rest yet drew me from it into life.</p>

<p>I could have sworn someone had touched me.
With some exclamation on my lips, I started up; to
find myself in darkness. The lamps I had left lighted
burned no longer.</p>

<p>This time there was no terror in my awakening.
No Thing of nightmare pressed against my window-space.
The fragrance persisted; the ghastly smell
of mould and corruption was gone. But I wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
light for all that! Reaching for the lamp beside me
on its stand, I found the little chain. I felt the
chain draw in my fingers and heard the click that
should have meant light; but no answering brightness
sprang up.</p>

<p>Instead, across the dark came a voice; a voice
low-pitched, soft without weakness, keen with
exultation:</p>

<p>"Victory! Victory! You have no need of
light&mdash;who conquered in darkness! The Enemy
has fled. It has covered the Unspeakable Eyes from
the eyes of a man. By the will of a man Its will
has been forbidden. It has dragged Itself back to
the Barrier and cowers there for this time. Oh,
soldier on the dreadful Frontier, be proud, putting
off your armor tonight! Be proud, and rest."</p>

<p>Those practical people who are never unnerved
by the intangible, may gauge if they can the weirdness
of this address following my first experience,
and then smile their contempt of me. For I confess
to a moment of uncanny chill. The voice was that
of the woman who had trailed her braid of hair into
my grasp, the night I first slept here. But, how
did she know of the Thing's visit to me? I had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
spoken nor uttered a cry throughout Its visitation.
How could she have knowledge of that silent struggle
between It and me, or of my escape so narrowly won.
How, unless she too&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>I groped for a glass of water left on my stand.
I drank, and felt my dry throat relax.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>A sigh trembled toward me.</p>

<p>"I am one who stands on the threshold of your
beautiful world, as a traveler stands outside a lighted
palace, gazing where she may not enter, and feeling
the winter about her."</p>

<p>"Do not suppose me quite a superstitious fool,"
I said bruskly. "You are a woman. The woman
who left a very real braid of hair in my hands, not
long ago, to save herself from capture!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yet, I am neither more nor less real than
the One which came for you a while since."</p>

<p>"Then my nightmare was real? A thing of
flesh and blood, or clever mechanism? You know it.
Perhaps you produced it?"</p>

<p>The rush of my angry suspicion dashed in useless
heat against her cool melancholy.</p>

<p>"Real? What is real?" she challenged me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
"Turn to the sciences that you should understand better
than I, and ask. Stretch out your arm. For a
million years men have vowed you touch empty air.
They saw and felt it empty. But now a child knows
air swarms with life. In that thin nothingness,
crowd and move the distributors of death, disease,
health, vigor&mdash;existence itself. The water you have
just tasted is pure and clear in the glass? Pure?
Each drop is an ocean of inhabitants clean and unclean.
I speak commonplaces. But is there no
knowledge not yet commonplace? Oh man, with
all the unfathomed universe about us, <i>dare</i> you pronounce
what is real?"</p>

<p>"What is natural," I began.</p>

<p>She interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Doubtless what is not natural cannot and does
not exist. Have you, then, measured Nature? He
was a great thinker, one of deep knowledge, who
compared Man to a child wandering on the shore of
a vast ocean and picking up a pebble here and there."</p>

<p>"Of what would you convince me? And, why?"</p>

<p>"Of what? Danger! Why? Would you watch
a man enter a jungle where some hideous beast
crouched in ambush, while you neither warned nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
armed him? I am here to turn you back. I
am the native of that country who runs to cry
warning to a stranger; to put into his hand the
weapon of understanding."</p>

<p>So solemn, so urgent a sincerity was in her voice,
that again chill touched me. The clammy dampness
of my garments hung on my limbs as a reminder of
the Thing, real or unreal, that twice had made Its
presence felt beyond denial. Wild as her words
might be, their incredible suggestion was matched
by my experience. I sought with my eyes for her,
before answering. The room was dark, yet the
darker bulk of furniture loomed out enough to be
distinguishable. No figure was visible, even traced
by the direction of her voice. I was certain that any
movement to seek her would mean her flight.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you want me to go away
from this place?" I questioned.</p>

<p>The sigh came again, just audibly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why should you die?"</p>

<p>Was I wrong in fancying the sigh regretful?
Did I not hear a wistful reluctance in her tone? Excitement
ran along my veins like burning oil on flowing
water. The woman hidden in the dark, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
association of her voice with the strange, exquisite
fragrance I breathed, the thought of beauty in her
born of that lovely braid of hair I had seized&mdash;all
blended in a spell of human magic. I have said I
was a man much alone, and a lame man who
craved adventure.</p>

<p>"Just now," I said, "you spoke of some victory.
You called me&mdash;soldier."</p>

<p>"Is it not victory to have driven back the Dark
One? Is he not a soldier who, aroused in the night
to meet dreadful assault, sets his face to the enemy
and battles front to front? Before the Eyes men
and women have died or lost reason, or fled across
half the world, broken by fear. What are the wars
of man with man, compared with a man's battle
against the Unknown? I honor you! I salute you!
But&mdash;soldier alone on the forbidden Frontier, go!
Join your fellows in the world alloted to you; live,
nor seek to tread where mankind is not sent."</p>

<p>"How can there be wrong in facing a situation
that I did not cause?"</p>

<p>"There is no wrong. There is danger."</p>

<p>"What danger?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"Can you ask me?" she retorted with a hint of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
impatience. "You who have felt Its grope toward
your inner spirit?"</p>

<p>I shuddered, remembering the brush of those
antenn&aelig;, exploring, examining! But I persisted, beyond
my every-day nature. Her speech was for me
like that liquor distilled from honey that inflamed
the Norsemen to war fury.</p>

<p>"You say I came off victor," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"Yes. But can you conquer again, and again,
and again? Will you not feel strength fail, health
break, madness creep close? Will you not be worn
down by the Thing that knows no weariness and
fall its prey at last?"</p>

<p>"It will come&mdash;often?"</p>

<p>"Until one conquers, It will come."</p>

<p>I forced away a qualm of panic.</p>

<p>"How can you know?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Ask me not. I do know."</p>

<p>"But, look here!" I argued. "If as you say,
this creature was not meant to meet mankind, how
can It come after me this way?"</p>

<p>She seemed to pause, finally answering with
reluctance:</p>

<p>"Because, two centuries ago one of the race<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of man here broke through the awful Barrier that
rears a wall between human kind and those dark
forms of life to which It belongs. For know that a
human will to evil can force a breach in that Barrier,
which those on the other side never could pass
without such aid."</p>

<p>I neither understood nor believed. At least, I
told myself that I did not believe her wild, legendary
explanation of the nightmare Thing that visited me.
I did not want to believe. Neither did I wish to
offend her by saying so!</p>

<p>"You will go," she presently mistook my silence
for surrender. "You are wise as well as brave.
Good go with you! Good walk beside you in that
happy world where you live!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" I cried sharply. Her voice had
seemed to recede from me, a retreating whisper at
the last word. "No! I will not go. I must&mdash;I
will know more of you. You are no phantom. Who
are you? Where&mdash;when can I see you in daylight?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I came to hold a light before the dreadful path.
The warning is given."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>"But you will come again?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"What? The Thing will come, and not you?"</p>

<p>"What have I to do with It, who am more
helpless before It than you? Go; and give thanks
that you may."</p>

<p>"Listen," I commanded, as firmly as I could.
"I am not going away from this house without better
reason. All this is too sudden and too new to
me. If you have more knowledge than I, you
have no right to desert me half-convinced of what
I should do."</p>

<p>"I can stay no longer."</p>

<p>"Why can you not come again?"</p>

<p>"You plan to trap me," she reproached.</p>

<p>"No. Word of honor! You shall come and go
as you please; I will not make a movement
toward you."</p>

<p>"Not try&mdash;to see me, even?" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Not even that, if you forbid."</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;" drifted to me, a faint distant
word on the wind that had begun to stir the tree-branches
and flutter through my room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>She was gone. There sounded a click whose
meaning did not at once strike me, intent as I was
upon the girl. Twice I spoke to her, receiving no
reply, before judging that I might rise without
breaking my promise. Then I recognized the click
of a moment before, as that of the electric switch
beside my door. No doubt she had turned off my
lights at her entrance and now restored them. I
pulled the chain of my reading-lamp, and this time
light flashed over the room.</p>

<p>I had known no one would be there, and no one
was. Yet I was disappointed.</p>

<p>As I drew on my dressing-gown I heard a clock
downstairs strike four. Not a breath or a step
stirred in the house. The damp freshness of coming
dawn crept in my windows, bringing scents of tansy
and bitter-sweet from the fields to strive against the
unknown fragrance in my room. The melancholy
depression of the hour weighed upon me. Beneath
the gentle strife of sweet odors, my nostrils seemed
to detect a lurking foulness of mould and decay.</p>

<p>I sat down at my desk, to wait beside the lamp
for the coming of sunrise.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For it is well known that Peris and such delicate beings

perfumes."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Oriental Mythology.</span></p></div>


<p>The breakfast bell, or rather Phillida's Chinese
chimes, merrily summoned me to the dining-room;
a homely spell to exercise the phantoms of the night.</p>

<p>My little cousin, rosy beyond belief, trim in white
middy blouse and blue skirt, was already in her place
behind the coffeepot. Vere sat opposite her at the
round table. They were holding hands across the
rolls and bacon and eggs, their glances interlocked in
a shining content that made my solitariness rather
drab and dull to my own contemplation. At my
clumsy step the picture dissolved, of course. Vere
rose while Phillida welcomed me to my chair and
went into a young housewife's pretty solicitude about
my fruit and hot eggs.</p>

<p>The sun glinted across the table. The very servant
had a smiling air of enjoying the occasion. I
never had a more pleasant breakfast. A big brindle
cat purred on the window-sill beside Phillida; no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
dainty Persian or Angora, but a battered veteran
whose nicked ears and scarred tail proved him a
battling cat of ring experience.</p>

<p>"I planned to have a wee white kitten," Phil
explained, while putting a saucer of milk before the
feline tough. "One that would wear a ribbon, you
know. You remember, Cousin Roger, how Mother
always forbade pets because she believed animals
carry germs? I meant to have a puss, if ever I had
a home of my own. This one just walked into the
kitchen on the first day we came here. Ethan said it
was a lucky sign when a cat came to a new home.
He gave it the meat out of his sandwiches that we
had brought for lunch, and it stayed. So I decided
to keep it instead of a kitten. It really is more cat!"</p>

<p>What footing was here for dreary terrors? In
a mirror across the room I glimpsed my own countenance
looking quite as usual. No over-night white
hairs appeared; no upstanding look such as the
legend gave to Sir Sintram after he met the
Little Master.</p>

<p>After the meal, Vere asked me to walk over to
the lake with him.</p>

<p>We strolled through the old orchard toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
dam. This was my side of the house. In passing,
I looked up at the window against which the Thing
had seemed to press Itself with sickening lust for
me. Phillida was framed in the open square, and
shook a dustcloth at us by way of greeting and
evidence of her busyness.</p>

<p>The wide, shallow lake lay almost without movement,
except at the head of the dam. There the
water poured over with foam and tumult, an amber-brown
cataract some twenty-odd feet across, to rush
on below in a winding stream that grew calmer
as it flowed.</p>

<p>"We must put our lake in order, Vere," I observed,
as we stood on a knoll at the head of the dam.
"All this growth of rank vegetation ought to be
pulled up, the banks graded and turfed perhaps, the
bottom cleaned up. Water-lilies would look better
than cat-tails."</p>

<p>To my surprise, he did not assent. Instead, he
set his foot on a boulder and rested his arm upon
his knee; looking into the clear water.</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke, I just about hate saying what I
have to," he told me in his sober, leisurely fashion.
"I expect you won't like it; not at all. Well&mdash;best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
said before you get deeper in. I can't see my way
to make farming this place pay."</p>

<p>I was bitterly disappointed. Even at the worst
estimate of Vere, I had imagined he would stick the
thing out a little longer than this. Poor Phillida's
time of happiness should have lasted more than these
few weeks. But the call of New York, of the
"lounge lizard's" ease and unhealthy excitement
had won already, it seemed. I said nothing at all.
The blow was too sore.</p>

<p>"There are too few acres of arable land, and
they're used up," Vere was continuing. "I've seen
plenty of impoverished, run-out farms in New England.
You could pour money into the soil out of
a gold pitcher these five years to come, before it
began to pay you back. And then your money
might better have been put anywhere in bank, for
profit! I saw that, the first week here. Since then
I've been looking around for something better to do."</p>

<p>"And have found it, of course," I said bitingly.
"Or else you would be drawing your salary as manager
and saying nothing to me of all this! Well,
where does poor Phil go, and when?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>He turned his dark-curled head and regarded me
with calm surprise.</p>

<p>"I didn't exactly know that my wife was going
anywhere, Mr. Locke."</p>

<p>"What? You do not mean to leave the farm?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you're tired of our bargain. I've
been calculating how to make it pay. That won't
be by planting corn and potatoes and taking a wagon-load
into town! If you think I'm wrong, call in any
practical man who knows this sort of business.
We've got to think closer to win here. That's why
I'd like to set the lake to work instead of just prettying
it up."</p>

<p>"The lake, Vere? There isn't enough water-power
over the dam to do any more than run a toy,
is there?"</p>

<p>He motioned me nearer to where he stood
gazing down.</p>

<p>"Notice what kind of water this is, Mr. Locke?
Brown like forest water, sort of green-lighted because
the bottom is like turf; neither mud nor sand,
but a kind of under-water moss? You see? It's
pure and clean, with a little fishy smell about it.
Matter of fact, it is forest water! Comes from way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
off yonder, the stream does, before it spreads out
into our lake, here. I borrowed a boat and followed
back two miles before it got too shallow for me.
Boys have caught trout here three times since I've
been watching."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"My father was fish-warden in our district. I
learned the business. If you're willing, I can start
some trout-raising that ought to pay well. You
know, the State is glad to help game preserving,
free."</p>

<p>He proceeded to give me a brief lecture on the
subject, in his quiet, unpretentious manner; producing
notes and diagrams from his pockets. He
had written to various authorities and exhibited their
replies. He knew exactly what the State would do,
what he himself must do, and what investment of
money would be required. I listened to him in admiration
and astonishment.</p>

<p>From fish raising, he went on to discuss each
acre of the farm; its best use in view of its situation,
condition, and our needs. We could afford so much
labor, it appeared, and no more. We must have
certain apparatus; methodically listed with prices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
If we used a certain sheltered south field for a peach
orchard, the trees planted should be such an age and
have giant-powder blast deep beds for them in order
that they might soon bear fruit.</p>

<p>When at last he ended his deceptive speech that
sounded so lazy while implying so much energy, and
turned his black eyes from the papers on his knee to
my face, I had been routed long since.</p>

<p>"Vere," I said abruptly, "did you know that I
thought you were going to desert the farm, when
you began to speak?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess so. You don't exactly like me;
haven't had any occasion to! You don't judge me a
fit match for your cousin. Well, neither would anyone
else, yet!"</p>

<p>He began to gather his papers together, his attention
divided with them while he finished his answer:</p>

<p>"There will be plenty of time before that 'yet'
runs out. Mighty pleasant time, thanks to you,
Mr. Locke! Phillida and I expect to enjoy building
things up as much as we'll enjoy it after they're all
built. Meantime, I prize what you're doing all the
more because I know how you feel. Now, if you'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
be interested to look over these plans or submit
them to someone you've confidence in, for inspection,
I'll just turn them over to you."</p>

<p>He had so accurately measured me that I was
disconcerted. It was quite true that he was compelling
my respect, while my first dislike of him
still obstinately lurked in the background of my mind.
I felt ungenerous, but I would not lie to him.</p>

<p>"I am a queer fellow, Vere," I said. "Leave
that to time, as you say! As for the plans, they
are far beyond my scope. A city man, it has been
my way to 'phone for an expert when anything was
to be done, or to buy what I fancied and pay the
bills. In this case, you are the expert. The plans
seem brilliant to me. Certainly they are moderate
in cost. Keep them, and carry them out as soon as
that may be done. You are master here, not I."</p>

<p>We walked back together through the sun and
freshness of the early spring morning. As we
neared the house Phillida's voice hailed us. She
was at my window again, leaning out with her hair
wind-ruffled about her face.</p>

<p>"Cousin Roger," she summoned me, "I have
found out what makes your room as sweet as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
garden of spices. See what it is to be a composer
completely surrounded by royalties, able to buy the
most gorgeous scents to lay on one's pillow! And
all enclosed in antique gold!"</p>

<p>She held up some small object that shone in
the sunlight. "Throw it down," I begged, startled
into excitement.</p>

<p>She complied, laughing. Vere sprang forward,
but I made a quicker step and caught the thing.</p>

<p>It was one of those filigree balls of gold wrought
into openwork, about the size of a walnut, that
fine ladies used to wear swung from a chain or ribbon
and call a pomander. The toy held a chosen
perfume or essence supposed to be reviving in case
miladi felt a swoon or megrim about to overwhelm
her; as ladies did in past centuries and do no longer.</p>

<p>Whose gentle pity had brought this pomander to
my pillow, to help me from that faintness which had
followed my struggle with the Thing? Whose was
the exquisite, individual fragrance contained in the
ball I held? I had a vision of a figure, surely light
and soft of movement, haloed with such matchless
hair as the braid I had captured, stealing step by
timid step across my room; within my reach while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
I lay inert. Perhaps her face had bent near mine
in her doubt of my life or death; hidden eyes had
studied me in the scanty starlight.</p>

<p>Oh, for Ethan Vere's good looks and athlete's
grace, to lure my lady from her masquerade!</p>

<p>"Where did you buy it, Cousin Roger? 'Fess
up!" Phillida's merry voice coaxed me.</p>

<p>"It was given to me," I slowly answered. "I
cannot offer it to you, Phil. But I will buy any other
pretty thing you fancy, instead, next time I go
to town."</p>

<p>She made a gesture of disclaim.</p>

<p>"I did not mean <i>that</i>! Only, do tell me what the
perfume is?"</p>

<p>"I was going to ask if you knew."</p>

<p>"No. Something very expensive and imported,
I suppose. Perhaps whoever gave it to you had it
made for herself alone, as some wealthy women do.
It is the most clinging, yet delicately refreshing scent
I ever met."</p>

<p>"Tuberose," suggested Vere.</p>

<p>"Drawls, no. How can you? Like an old-fashioned
funeral!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Tuberose didn't always go to funerals," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
corrected her teasingly, as she made a face at him.
"I remember them growing in my Aunt Bathsheba's
garden. Creamy looking posies, kind of kin to a
gardenia, seems to me! Thick-petalled, like white
plush, and holding their sweet smell everlastingly.
But Mr. Locke's perfumery isn't just that, either.
There was something else grew in that garden&mdash;I
can't call to mind what I mean. Basil, maybe?"</p>

<p>"The basil plant, that feeds on dead men's
brains," quoted Phil with a mock shiver. "You <i>are</i>
happy in your ideals, Drawls!"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, that garden smelled pretty fine when the
dew was just warming up in the sun, mornings&mdash;and
so does this little gilt ball! I'll guess Mr. Locke's
lady never got it from France. Smells like old
New England."</p>

<p>There was no reason why a vague chill should
creep over me, or the sunshine seem to darken as
if a thin veil drifted between me and the surrounding
brightness. Let me say again that no place could
have been more unlike the traditional haunted house.
There hung about it no sense of morbidity or depression.
Yet, what was I to think? I was not sick or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
mad; and the Thing had come to me twice. I turned
from the married lovers and made my way to the
veranda, where I might be alone to consider the
pomander whose perfume was like a diaphanous presence
walking beside me.</p>

<p>Seated there, in one of the deep willow-chairs
Phillida had cushioned in peacock chintz and marked
especially mine by laying my favorite magazines on
its arm, I studied my new trophy of the night. There
was a satisfaction in its material solidity. It was real
enough, resting in my palm.</p>

<p>Yes; but it was not ordinary among its quaint
kind! As I picked out the design of the gold-work,
that fact was borne in upon my mind. Here was no
pattern of scroll or blossom or cupids and hearts.
The small sphere was belted with the signs of the
Zodiac, beautiful in minute perfection. All the rest
of the globe was covered with lace-fine work repeating
one group of characters over and over. I was
not learned enough to tell what the characters were,
but the whole plainly belonged to those strange, outcast
academies of astrology, alchemy&mdash;magic, in
short. It contained what appeared to be a pinkish
ball; originally a scented paste rolled round and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
dried, I judged by peering through the interstices
of the gold.</p>

<p>Had the old-world trinket been left to bewilder
me? Why, and by whom? What interest had my
lady of the dark in elaborately deceiving me? Why
muffle her identity in mystery? Why the indefinable
quaintness of language, the choice of words that
made her speech so different from even the college-bred
Phillida's?</p>

<p>She urged me to leave the house. If she, or
anyone associated with her wanted the place left
vacant for some reason, why did not the Thing and
the warning come to others of our household group?
Vere, Phillida, the Swedish woman, Cristina&mdash;all
had lived here for weeks without any experiences like
mine. I had not been told to leave my room, but
the house. The danger, then, was only for me?</p>

<p>Well, was I to run away, hands over my eyes, at
the first alarm?</p>

<p>The gray cat came purring about me and presently
leaped upon my knee. On impulse, I offered
the pomander to its nostrils. The unwinking yellow
eyes shut, the beast's powerful claws closed and
unclosed with convulsive pleasure, it breathed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that thirsty eagerness for the scent so familiar to
my own senses.</p>

<p>"Better than catnip, Bagheera?" I questioned.
"You wouldn't bolt from it, either, would you?"</p>

<p>Phillida's battered pet relaxed luxuriously, by
way of answer, sniffed toward the hand I withdrew,
and composed itself to sleep. I put the pomander
in my waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>I could not deny as mere nightmare the Thing
which had visited me. Better confront that fact! It
was real. Only, real in what sense? What human
agency could produce an effect so frightful, an illusion
so hideous that I could scarcely bear to recall
it here in full daylight, without the use of a sight
or sound to confuse the brain?</p>

<p>Had the girl told the truth in her wild explanation?
A truth hinted at by alchemists, Pythagoreans,
Rosicrucians, pale students of sorcery and magnificent
charlatans, these many centuries? Were
there other races between earth and heaven; strange
tribes of the middle spaces whose destinies were fixed
and complete as our own, but between whose lives
and ours were fixed barriers not to be crossed? Had
I met one of these beings, inimical to man as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
cobra, intelligent as man, hunting Its victim by
methods unknown to us?</p>

<p>Was I a cheated fool, or a pioneer on the borders
of a new country?</p>

<p>Could I meet that Thing tonight, and tomorrow
night? Could I bear the agony of Its presence, the
stench of death and corruption that was Its atmosphere?
At the mere memory my forehead grew wet.</p>

<p>The postman's buggy had stopped at our mailbox.
Phillida ran down to meet the event of the morning.
Her laughing chatter came back to me while she
waited, fists thrust in middy pockets, for the old man
to sort our letters from his bags. It did not appear
so hard to make a woman happy, I mused. A man
might attempt it with hope, if he could but persuade
her to try him.</p>

<p>My lady had promised to come again. Perhaps,
with patience&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Phillida came across the lawn with an armful
of gaudy-covered catalogues and a handful of letters.</p>

<p>"Catalogues for Ethan; letters for you," she
called in advance of her arrival. "What an important
person you are, Cousin Roger! It always gives
me a quivery thrill to realize <i>who</i> you are as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
as how nice you are. Now, isn't that a jumbled
speech to tumble out of me?"</p>

<p>I took her tanned little hand along with the letters;
letters that were so many voices summoning
me back to pleasant, busy Manhattan.</p>

<p>"It is a fine speech for a humble person to answer,
Phil! But does that sort of thing matter to
you women? What do you love Vere for, at bottom?
Because he is strong and supple and has curly
hair? No?" as she shook her head. "Because he
has worn the uniform, then; proved his courage in
war at sea? Because he had the glamour about him
of real adventure and cabaret glitter? Or because he
took you away from a life you hated? Or, perhaps,
because he is kind and loves you? No! For none of
these reasons? Why, then, love Ethan Vere?"</p>

<p>She stopped vigorously shaking her head in repeated
denial, and smiled at me triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Because he <i>is</i> Ethan Vere," she promptly responded.
"Oh, Cousin Roger, you clever people are
so stupid! It would not make any difference at all
if Drawls were ugly, or never had been a sailor, or
could not skate or do things, or had not been able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
make me happy. It is something very much bigger
than all that!"</p>

<p>"And all the divorce courts, Phil? The breach
of promise suits, and the couples who make each
other miserable?"</p>

<p>"But they never had anything," she said. "Perhaps
they will have it, some day. Don't you know,
Cousin Roger, that the most important things in the
world are those most people never know about?"</p>

<p>I was not sure whether I knew that, or not. After
last night, I was not sure of many things. Still, if
such gifts were given as she believed, if it was
merely a question of being Ethan Vere&mdash;or
Roger Locke&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>But I had never seriously considered leaving
the adventure.</p>

is not sufficient for a kite's dinner, yet the whole world is not
sufficient for it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hugo de Anima.</span></p></div>


<p>That evening Vere and I settled the business
details of the developments he had planned. Also
while we three were quietly together, I launched a
discussion that had been gathering in my mind all
day while I watched Phillida.</p>

<p>"You are doing as efficient work as Vere," I
told her. "In fact, you are a most moderate pair!
I gave you an open bank account, Phil; and you have
furnished the house for so little that I am amazed.
And it is all so gay, so freshly pretty! Being an
ignorant man, the details are beyond me. But&mdash;one
servant? Aren't you working yourself too hard?
I had expected you to need several. Of course, we
are not counting Vere's outdoor force."</p>

<p>She turned in her low chair beside the lamp and
glanced toward the window behind her, before replying.
I noticed the action, because a moment before
Vere had turned precisely the same way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>"It is good of you to think of those things,
Cousin Roger," she declared. "But, I want to be a
real wife to Drawls. I do, indeed! And I have it
all to learn because I was not brought up for that.
Look at this dish-towel I am hemming. Cristina
would laugh at the stitches if she dared, yet they
are better than when I began. Some day I shall sew
fine things. So it is with all my housekeeping. I
think we should begin as we mean to go on, so I
have furnished the house for&mdash;us. Perhaps if it
had been for you alone, I should have chosen satin-wood
and tapestry instead of willow and cretonne.
The same way about Cristina. If Ethan and I are
to save and earn this lovely place, as you offered,
we cannot afford more than one maid. You understand
what I am trying to explain, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I assented. "Surely! What were you
looking for, just now, behind you?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, nothing! I just fancied someone had
passed by the window and stared in. I can't imagine
what made me fancy that. Unless the cat&mdash;&mdash;"
She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Bagheera is asleep under Mr. Locke's chair,"
Vere observed casually.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"Truly, Cousin Roger, I love the way we are
living," she resumed. "It is very miserable of me,
I daresay, not to be more intellectual after all Father
and Mother labored with me. But it is so! I want
to live this way all my life; to be busy, and
plan things with Ethan, and make them come
true together."</p>

<p>Under cover of the table she put her hand into
Vere's, and silence held us a little while. I watched
Bagheera the cat, who sat beside my chair staring
with unblinking yellow eyes toward the window
across the room. Did I imagine a slight uneasiness
in those eyes, a wary readiness in gathered limbs and
muscles bulking under the old cat's scant fur? Now
the tail twitched with a lashing movement.</p>

<p>Presently Bagheera looked away and relaxed. A
moment more, and he curled down, composing himself
to sleep.</p>

<p>"You like the place, Phil?" I questioned. "You
do not find it lonely here, or in any way depressing?"</p>

<p>The candor of her surprise told me that no
dweller between the worlds had visited her.</p>

<p>"Cousin Roger? This darling house? Why?"</p>

<p>I passed that question safely, and after a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
minutes bade them good-night. They had a fashion
of gazing at one another that made it a matter of
necessary kindness to leave them alone together.</p>

<p>As I made my solitary way upstairs, I will not
deny a growing excitement, or that dread fought
with my resolution. Who would keep tryst with me
tonight? The Horror or the lady? Both; as each
time before? If so, which one would come first, and
what might be my measure of success or failure?
If some trick were being played upon me, I meant
to pluck it out of the mystery.</p>

<p>The quietly pleasant room received me without
a hint of the unusual. I lighted the lamps and sat
down to my work.</p>

<p>The house was still by ten o'clock, all lights out
except mine. At midnight I lay down in the dark,
the pomander under my pillow. Whether I put the
gold ball there from sentiment, or from some absurd
fancy about its perfume and mystic carving being
somehow a talisman against evil, or because I feared
the trinket might be taken from me during the night,
I should be troubled to answer. I did place it there,
and lay lapped in its sweet odor while the moments
dragged past; heavy, slow-footed moments of strain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and dreadful expectation scarcely relieved by a hope
uneasy as fear.</p>

<p>The cock crowed for the first hour; and for the
second. I slept, at last. When I awoke, level sun-rays
were striking across the world.</p>

<p>Nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Next morning, I took my car and began a systematic
investigation of the neighborhood. There
proved to be few houses within reasonable distance
where such a woman as my lady could be lodged.
However, I made my cautious inquiries even where
the quest seemed useless, resolved to leave no chance
untried. No better plan occurred to me than exhibition
of the pomander with a vague story of wishing
to return it to a young lady with red-gold hair. But
nowhere did a native show recognition of the top or
the description.</p>

<p>On my way home I overtook a familiar, travel-stained
buggy that inspired me with a fresh disrespect
for my own abilities. Why had I not put my
question to our rural mail deliverer in the beginning?
Surely here was a man who knew everyone and
went everywhere!</p>

<p>The old white horse rolled placid eyes toward the
car that drew up beside it, then returned to cropping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the young grass by the roadside. The postman
looked up from the leather sack open before him,
and nodded to me.</p>

<p>"Morning, Mr. Locke," he greeted. "Now let
me get the right stuff into this here box, an' I'll sort
your family's right out for you. There's a sample
package of food sworn to make hens lay or kill 'em,
for Cliff Brown here, that's gone to the bottom of
the bag. I don't know but Cliff's poultry'd thank
me to leave it be! Up it's got to come, though!"</p>

<p>"Will it make them lay?" I asked, watching the
ruddy old face peering into the sack.</p>

<p>"I guess it might, if Cliff told 'em they'd have to
lay or eat it, judgin' from the smell that sample's put
in my bag."</p>

<p>"Not as sweet as this?" I suggested, and leaned
across to lay the pomander in his gnarled hand.</p>

<p>The familiar expression of acute, almost greedy
pleasure flowed into his face. His nostrils expanded
with eager intake of the perfume that seemed an
elixir of delight. He said nothing, absorbed
in sensation.</p>

<p>"Do you know of a lady who wears that scent?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
I asked. "A lady with bright fair hair, colored like
copper-bronze?"</p>

<p>"Not I!" he denied briefly.</p>

<p>"No one at all like that&mdash;with hair warmer in
shade than ordinary gold color, and a lot of it?"</p>

<p>"No. Not around here, nor anywhere I've been!
What do you call this perfumery, Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," I answered, sharply disappointed.
"No one knows except the young lady I
am trying to find. Are you sure you cannot help me
at all? There is no newcomer in the neighborhood,
no visitor at any house who might be the one I am
looking for?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, giving back the pomander
with marked reluctance.</p>

<p>"No one who might be able to tell more than
yourself?" I persisted.</p>

<p>A gleam of humor lit his eyes. He dropped a
cardboard cylinder into Mr. Clifford Brown's mailbox
and began to sort out my letters.</p>

<p>"Far as that goes, I guess Mis' Hill don't miss
much of what goes on around here. When she hears
a good bit of tattle, she has her husband hitch up, and
she goes drivin' all day. Ain't a house she knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
that don't get to hear the whole yarn! You know
Mis' Royal Hill? Mis' Vere gets butter and cheese
from her. Might ask her!"</p>

<p>I thanked him and drove on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill, garrulous wife of the farmer who
owned the place next to ours, was on her porch when
I came to a halt before the house. She granted me
more interest than the other natives upon whom I
had called that morning; inviting me into her parlor
to "set," when she had identified me. But she knew
nothing of the object of my quest.</p>

<p>"I guessed you must be the new owner up to the
Michell place," she observed, her beady, faded brown
eyes busy with my appearance, picking up details in
avid, darting little glances suggestive of a bird pecking
crumbs. "Cliff Brown said a lame feller had
bought it. I don't see as that little limp cripples you
much, the way you can rampus 'round in that fast
automobile of yours! Now, I'm perfectly sound, and
I wouldn't be paid to drive the thing. You'd ought
to get the other fellow to run it for you; the handsome
one. I guess you like to do it, though?
Writer, ain't you? Books or newspapers?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>I rallied my scattered faculties to answer the
machine-gun attack.</p>

<p>"Music?" she echoed, her narrow, sun-dried
face wrinkling into new lines of inquisitiveness.
"They said you had a piano in your bedroom, but
I thought they were just foolin' me! Seems I never
heard of havin' a piano upstairs. Most folks like to
show 'em off in the parlor. Must be kind of funny,
takin' your company upstairs to play for 'em. But
then it's kind of a funny thing for a man to take to,
anyhow! I got a niece ten years old next August who
can play piano so good there don't seem anythin' left
to learn her, so&mdash;&mdash;! But there ain't no use of you
drivin' 'round here lookin' for a fair-headed girl,
Mr. Locke. The Slav folk down in the shanties by
the post road are about the only light-complected ones
in this neighborhood. Somehow, we run mostly to
plain brown. Senator Allen has two girls, but
they're only home from a boardin' school for vacation.
How do you like your place?"</p>

<p>"Very much," I assured her. "Only, I do not
know a great deal about it, yet. Its history, I mean.
Are there any interesting stories about the house?
You know, we city people like a nice legend or ghost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
story to tell our friends when they come to visit us."</p>

<p>She chuckled, swinging in her plush-covered
rocking-chair, arms folded on her meagre breast.</p>

<p>"Guess you'll have to make one up! I never
heard of none. The Michell family always owned
it&mdash;and they were so stiff respectable an' upright
everyone was scared of 'em! Most of the men were
clergymen in their time. The last, Reverend Cotton
Mather Michell, went abroad to foreign parts for
missionary work with the heathen, twenty-odd years
ago; an' died there. He never married, so the
family's run out. The Michells were awful hard on
women; called 'em vessels of wrath an' beguilers of
Adam. Preached it right out of the pulpit&mdash;so I
guess no girl in these parts could have been hired
to wed with him, if he'd wanted. His mother died
when he was born, so he'd had no softenin' influence.
After news came of his death, the house was shut up
'till you bought it. My, how you've changed it,
already! I'd admire to go through it."</p>

<p>When I had invited her to call on Phillida and
inspect our domicile, and paid due thanks for information
received, she followed me out to the car.</p>

<p>"All this land 'round here is old and full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Indian relics," she remarked. "Over to the Sound
where the swamps used to be, there was lots of
fightin' with savages. An' they say a witch was
stoned to death where the Catholic convent stands
now, on the road up above your place. So I guess
you can figure out a story to tell your company,
if you like."</p>

<p>"A convent?" I repeated, my attention caught
by a new possibility. "Do they, perhaps, have visitors
there, ladies in retreat for a time, as convents
often do abroad?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill laughed, shaking her tightly-combed
head.</p>

<p>"No hope of your girl there," she chuckled.
"They're the strictest sisterhood in America, folks
say. Poor Clares, I think they're called. No one,
not even their relations, ever see their faces after
they join. They're not allowed to talk to each other,
even. Just stay in their cells, an' pray, even in the
middle of the night, an' shave their heads an' live on
a few vegetables an' dry bread."</p>

<p>I laughed with her. Certainly no convent would
harbor my lady of marvelous tresses and magical
perfume, of wild fancies and heretical theories. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
thought of mine was indeed far afield. But where,
then, was I next to seek?</p>

<p>I made a detour and used some strategy to gain
a view of the Senator's daughters. They proved to
be brunettes who wore their locks cropped after the
fashion of certain Greenwich villagers. My disappointment
was not great; my lady was not suggestive
of a boarding-school miss. But I had hoped to find
somewhere a trace of the copper-bronze head whose
royalty of hair I had shorn as the traitors shore
King Childeric's Gothic locks.</p>

<p>I drove home with a sense of blankness upon me.
Suppose she never came again? Suppose the episode
was ended? Not even freedom from the Thing
could compensate for the baffled adventure.</p>

<p>Think of the lame feller with an Adventure!</p>

<p>For myself, I have always found that excitement
stimulates imagination. There are others, I know,
who can do no creative work except when all within
and without is lulled and calm. Perhaps I have too
much calm as an ordinary thing! That evening,
when I went to my room, lighted my lamps and closed
my door, I stood alone for awhile breathing the
mingled sweetness of the country air and the pomander
ball. In that interval, there came to me, complete
and whole as a gift thrust into my hand, the
melody which an enthusiastic publisher since assured
me has reached every ear in America.</p>

<p>As to that extravagant statement, I can only
measure by the preposterous amount of money the
melody has brought me. Perhaps there is a magic
about it. For myself, I cannot hear it&mdash;ground on
a street-organ, given on the stage, played on a phonograph
record or delicately rendered by an orchestra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>&mdash;without
feeling again the exaltation and enchantment
of that night.</p>

<p>I flung myself down at my writing-table, tossing
my former work right and left to make room for this.
If it should escape before I could set it down! If
the least of those airy cadences should be lost!</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning I came back to
realization of time and place. The composition was
finished; it stood up before me like a flower raised
over-night. Eight hours had passed since I sat down
to the work, after dinner. I was tired. As I began
to draw into a pile the sheets of paper I had covered
with notes, weariness gripped me like a hand.</p>

<p>Eight hours? If I had shoveled in a ditch twice
that long I could have felt no more exhausted.
Yielding to drained fatigue of mind and body, I
dropped my head upon the arms I folded upon the
table. My hot, strained eyes closed with relief, my
stiff fingers relaxed. Rest and content flowed over
me; my work was done, and good.</p>

<p>Rest passed into sleep, no doubt.</p>

<p>The sleep could not have been long, for not many
hours remained before dawn. When I started awake
and lifted my head, I found the room in darkness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
A perfume was in the air, and the sense of a presence
scarcely more tangible than the perfume. Even in
the first dazed moment, I knew my lady had
come again.</p>

<p>"Do not rise!" her murmuring voice cautioned
me. "Unless you wish me to go?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"I am here because I promised to come. It was
not wise of you to ask that of me."</p>

<p>"Then I prefer folly to wisdom," I answered,
steadying myself to full wakefulness. "Or, rather,
I am not sure that you can decide for me which
is which!"</p>

<p>"Why? After all, why? Just&mdash;curiosity?"</p>

<p>"You, who speak so learnedly of magic and
sorcery," I retorted, smiling under cover of the
darkness, "have you never heard of the white magic
conjured by a tress of hair, a perfume ball, and a
voice sweeter than the perfume? An image of wax
does not melt before a witch's fire so easily as a
man before these things."</p>

<p>"My hair pleased you?" she questioned na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>"Or so easily as a woman melts before admiration!"
I supplemented. "I am delighted to prove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
you human, mystic lady. Please me? Could anyone
fail to be pleased with that most magnificent braid?
But how can either you or I forgive the cruelty that
took it from its owner? Why did you cut it off?"</p>

<p>"So little of it! And I did not know you, then."</p>

<p>"Little? That braid?"</p>

<p>"It reached below my knee, now it is but little
less," she answered with indifference. "We all have
such hair."</p>

<p>I gasped. My imagination painted the picture of
all that shining richness enwrapping a slim young
body. It was fantastic beyond belief to sit there
at my desk, beneath my fingers the tools of sober,
workaday life, and stare into the dark room that held
the reality of my vision. She was there, but I could
not rise and find her. She was opposite my eyes,
but my promise forbade me to touch the lamp and
see her.</p>

<p>"Who are 'we'?" I slowly followed her last
sentence.</p>

<p>A sigh answered me. On the silence, a memory
floated to me of the story she had told while I held
her prisoner that first night:</p>

<p>"<i>The woman sits in her low chair.</i> The fire-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span><i>shine
is bright in her eyes and in her hair. On either
side, her hair flows down to the floor.</i>"</p>

<p>Yes, by legend young witches had such hair;
sylphs, undines and all of the airy race of Lilith. I
thrust absurdities away from me and offered a quotation
to fill the pause:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">"'I met a lady in the meads'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Full beautiful; a faery's child.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Her hair was long, her foot was light,'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'And her eyes were wild.'"<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>She did not laugh, or put away the suggestion.
When I had decided that she did not mean to reply,
and was seeking my mind for new speech to detain
her with me, she finally spoke what seemed another
quotation:</p>

<p>"'A spirit&mdash;one of the invisible inhabitants of
this planet, neither departed souls nor angels; concerning
whom Josephus and Michael Psellus of
Constantinople may be consulted. They are very
numerous, and there is no climate or element without
one or more.' Have you read the writings of
the learned Jew or of the Platonist, you who are so
very bold?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>"Neither," I meekly admitted. "But neither
ancient gentleman could convince me that you
are unhuman."</p>

<p>Her answer was just audible:</p>

<p>"Not I&mdash;but, It!"</p>

<p>Now I was silenced, for dreadful and uncanny
was that whisper in the dark to a man who had met
here in this room What I had met.</p>

<p>"Tell me more of this Thing without a name,"
I urged, mastering my reluctance to evoke even the
idea of what the blood curdled to recall. "Why
does It hate me?"</p>

<p>"What can I tell you? Even in your world,
does not evil hate good as naturally as good recoils
from evil? But this One has another cause also!"
She hesitated. "And you yourself? How have you
challenged and mocked It this very night? Here,
where It glooms, you have dared bring the high joy
of the artist who creates? Oh, brave, brave!&mdash;he
who could await alone the visit of the Unspeakable,
in the chamber into which the Loathsome Eyes have
looked, and write the music of hope and beauty!"</p>

<p>I started, with a hot rush of surprise and pleasure.
She had heard my work. She approved it. More<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
than that, not to her was I the lame fellow who ought
to get a better man to drive his car!</p>

<p>"Nor should you, who have two worlds of your
own," she added in a lower tone, "doubt the existence
of many both dark and bright. Go, then, out of
this haunted place where a human madness broke
through the Barrier. Be satisfied with the victories
you have had. Let the visits of the Dark One fade
into mere nightmare; and know I am no more a living
woman than Franchina Descartes."</p>

<p>"Who was she?"</p>

<p>"Have you not read that early in the seventeenth
century there appeared in Paris the philosopher
Descartes, accompanied by the figure of a beautiful
woman? She moved, spoke, and seemed life itself;
but Descartes declared she was an automaton, a
masterpiece of mechanism he himself had made. Yet
many refused to believe his story, declaring he had
by sorcery compelled a spirit to serve him in this
form. He called her Franchina, his daughter."</p>

<p>"And the truth?"</p>

<p>"I have told you all the record tells. She was
soon lost. Descartes took her with him upon a journey
by sea; when, a storm arising, the superstitious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
captain of the vessel threw the magic beauty into
the Mediterranean."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But, are you fairy or automaton?"</p>

<p>"Do not laugh," she exclaimed with sudden passion.
"You know I would say that I have no part
in the world of men and women. Not through me
shall the ancient dread seize a new life. A little time,
now, then the doors will close upon me as the sea
closed over Franchina. I will not take with me the
memory of a wrong done to you. I shall never come
to this house after tonight. If you would give me
a happiness, promise me you will leave, too."</p>

<p>I had known we should come to this point. After
a moment, I spoke as quietly as I could:</p>

<p>"Tell me your name."</p>

<p>She had not expected that question. I think she
might have withheld the answer, given time to reflect.
But as it was, she replied docilely as a
bidden child:</p>

<p>"Desire Michell."</p>

<p>The name fell quaintly on both hearing and
fancy, with a rustle of early New England tradition.
Desire! I repeated it inwardly with satisfaction before
I answered her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>"Thank you. Now, I, Roger Locke, do promise
you, Desire Michell, that I will not leave this house
until these matters are plainer to my understanding,
whether you go or stay. But if you go and come
no more, then I surely shall stay until I find a way
to trace you or until the Thing kills me."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then, to my utter dismay,
I heard her sobbing through the dark.</p>

<p>"Why do you tempt me?" she reproached. "Is
it not hard enough, my duty? For me it is such pleasure
to be here&mdash;to leave for a while the loneliness
and chill of my narrow place! But you, so rich in all
things, free and happy&mdash;how should it matter to
you if a voice in the dark speaks or is silent? Let
me go."</p>

<p>Wonder and exulting sense of power filled me.</p>

<p>"I can keep you, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;so weak."</p>

<p>"Desire Michell, I am as alone as you can be,
in my real life. I have gone apart from much that
occupies men and women; gaining and losing in different
ways. One of the gains is freedom to dispose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of myself without grief or loss to anyone, except
the perfunctory regret of friends. Will you believe
there is no risk that I would not take for a few hours
with you? Even with your voice in the dark? Come
to me as you can, let us take what time we may, and
the chances be mine."</p>

<p>"But that is folly! You do not know. To protect
you I must go."</p>

<p>"I refuse the protection. Stay! If there is
sorrow in knowing you, I accept it. I understand
nothing. I only beg you not to turn me back to the
commonplace emptiness of life before I found you.
Indeed, I will not be sent away."</p>

<p>"If I yield, you will reproach me some day."</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"It could only be like this&mdash;that we should speak
a few times before the gates close upon me."</p>

<p>"What gates?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"Very well," I took what the moment would
grant me. "That is a bargain. Yet, what safety lies
in secrecy between us? If we are to help each other,
as I hope, would not plain openness be best? You
will tell me no more about yourself? Very well. Tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
me something more about the enemy in the dark
whom I am to meet. You have hinted that It has a
special motive for fixing hate upon me beyond mere
malignance toward mankind. What is that motive?"</p>

<p>"Ask me not," she faintly refused me.</p>

<p>"I do ask you. My ignorance of everything concerned
is a heavy drawback in this combat. Arm
me with a little understanding. What moves It
against me?"</p>

<p>The pause following was filled with a sense of
difficulty and recoil, her struggle against some terrible
reluctance. So painful was that effort, somehow
clearly communicated to me, that I was about
to devour my curiosity and withdraw the question
when her whisper just reached my hearing:</p>

<p>"Jealousy!"</p>

<p>"Jealousy? Of what? For whom?"</p>

<p>"For&mdash;me."</p>

<p>The monstrous implication sank slowly into my
understanding; then brought me erect, gripping the
edge of the table lest I forget restraint and move
toward her.</p>

<p>"By what right?" I cried. "By what claim?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Desire Michell, what has the Horror to do
with you?"</p>

<p>The vehemence and heat of my cry struck a
shock through the hushed room distinct as the shattering
of crystal. There was no answer, no movement;
no rebuke of my movement. I was alone.
With that confession she had fled.</p>

<p>My cry had been louder than I knew. Presently
I heard a door open. Steps sounded along the hall
from the rooms on the opposite side of the house.
Someone knocked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Mr. Locke?" Vere's voice
came through the panels.</p>

<p>I crossed to the door and opened it. He stood
at the threshold, an electric torch in his hand.</p>

<p>"We thought you called," he apologized. "I
thought maybe you were sick, or wanted something;
and no light showed around your door."</p>

<p>I found the wall switch and turned on the lamps.
As on the last occasion, she had switched the lights
off there, beyond my reach unless I broke my promise
not to move about the room while she remained
my guest.</p>

<p>"Come in," I invited him. "Much obliged to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and Phillida for looking me up! I had been working
late and dropped asleep in my chair, with a nightmare
as the result."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to have his normal presence,
prosaic in bathrobe and pajamas, in my cheerfully
lighted room. His dark eyes glanced toward the
music-scrawled papers scattered about, then returned
to meet my eyes smilingly.</p>

<p>"We heard some of that work," he admitted.
"Phil and I&mdash;well, I guess we were guilty of sitting
on the stairs to hear you play it over. I never listened
to a tune that took hold of me, kind of, like that
one. We'd certainly prize hearing all of it together,
sometime, if you didn't mind."</p>

<p>The warmth of achievement flowed again in me.
I crossed to the piano to assemble the finished sheets,
answering him with one of those expressions of
thanks artists use to cloak modestly their sleek inward
vanity. I was really grateful for this first
criticism that soothed me back to the reality of
my own world.</p>

<p>Across the top of the uppermost sheet of music, in
small, square script quaint as the pomander, was
written a quotation strange to me:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>"We walk upon the shadows of hills across a
level thrown, and pant like climbers."</p>

<p>I did not know that I had read the words aloud
until Vere answered them.</p>

<p>"So we do! I guess there is more panting over
shadows and less real mountain-climbing done by us
humans than most folks would believe. Most roads
turn off to easy ways before we reach the hills
we make such a fuss about. Who wrote that,
Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied vaguely, intent upon
Desire Michell's meaning in leaving this to me.</p>

<p>He nodded, and turned leisurely to go.</p>

<p>"Kind of seems to me as if he must have felt
like you did when you wrote that piece tonight," he
observed diffidently. "As if trouble did not amount
to much, taken right. I'll get back to Phil, now.
She might be anxious."</p>

<p>Could that be what Desire had meant me to
understand? Was there indeed some quality
of courage&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>That is why my most successful composition
from the standpoint of money and popularity went
to the publisher under the title, "Shadows of Hills."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Of course no one connected the allusion. The general
interpretation was best expressed by the cover
design of the first printing: a sketch of a mountain-shaded
lake on which floated a canoe containing two
young persons. I was well pleased to have it so.</p>

<p>But&mdash;in what land unknown to man towered the
vast mountains in whose shadow I panted and
strove? Or was my foot indeed upon the mountain
itself?</p>

<p>I did not know. I do not know, now.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If the Dreamer finds himself in an unknown place, ignorant
of the country and the people, let him be aware that such place
is to be understood of the Other World."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Oneirocritica

<p>In the morning I drove down to New York.
There were affairs demanding attention. Also, I
was pressed by an eagerness to get my over-night
work into the hands of the publisher. To be exact,
I wanted to put the manuscript out of reach of the
Thing at the house. Without reason, I had awakened
with that instinct strong within me.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the city was tonic. Merely
driving through the friendly, crowded streets was
an exhilaration. The practical employment of the
day broomed away fantastic cobwebs. In the evening
I turned toward Connecticut with a feeling of
leaving home behind me. But I would not stay away
from the house for a night, risking that Desire
Michell might come and find me missing. She might
believe I had been seized by cowardice and deserted.
She might never return.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>I will not deny that I had lied to her. There was
no intention in me of accepting her fleeting visits
as the utmost she could give. I meant to snatch
her out of darkness and mystery, to set her in the
wholesome sunlight where Phillida flitted happily.
If I could prevent, those gates of which she vaguely
spoke never should close between us. But it was
plain that I must tread warily. Once frightened
away, how could she be found? Her home, her history,
even her face, were unknown to me. Tracing
her by a perfume and a tress of hair had been tried,
and failed. Of her connection with the Dark Thing
I refused to think too deeply. Her connection with
me must come first.</p>

<p>It was not until I passed the cottage of Mrs. Hill,
glimmering whitely in the starlight, where the road
made an angle toward the farm, that I recalled our
talk in her "best room."</p>

<p>"<i>The Michell family always owned it. The
Reverend Cotton Mather Michell went to foreign
parts for missionary work twenty years ago and
died there&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>My lady of the night was Desire Michell.
A clue?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>"<i>He never married, so the family's run out.</i>"</p>

<p>It was damp here in the hollow where the road
dipped down. A chill ran coldly over me.</p>

<p>Arrived at the garage which had taken the place
of our tumble-down barn, I put the car away as
quietly as possible. Ten o'clock had struck as I
passed through the last village, and our household was
asleep. Moving without unnecessary noise, I crossed
to the house. Bagheera, the cat, padded across the
porch to meet me and rubbed himself around my legs
while I stooped to put the latch-key in the lock.</p>

<p>As the key slid in place, I heard the waterfall
over the dam abruptly change the sound of its flow,
swelling and accelerating as when a gust of wind
hurries a greater volume of water over the brink.
But there was no wind. Immediately followed that
sound from the lake which I can liken to nothing
better than the smack of huge lips unclosing, or the
suck of a thick body drawing itself from a bed of
mud. The cat thrust himself violently between my
feet and pressed against the house-door uttering a
whimpering mew of urgency. Startled, I looked in
the direction of the lake.</p>

<p>At this distance it showed as a mere expanse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
darkness, only the reflection of a star here and there
revealing the surface as water. What else could be
shown, I rebuked my nerves by querying of them;
and turned the key. Bagheera rushed into the hall
when the door opened wide enough to admit his body.
I followed more sedately and closed the door behind
us both.</p>

<p>Now I was not acquainted with Bagheera's night
privileges. Did Phillida allow him in the house, or
not? After an instant's consideration, I bent and
picked him up from his repose on the hall rug. He
should spend the night shut in with me, out of mischief
yet comfortable. Purring in the curve of my
arm, he was carried upstairs without objection on his
part. Until we reached my room! On its threshold
I felt his body stiffen; his yellow eyes snapped open
alertly. Cat antipathy to a strange place, I reflected,
amused, as I switched on the lights.</p>

<p>"All right, Bagheera," I spoke soothingly, and
put him upon the rug.</p>

<p>He bounded erect, fur bristling, tail lashing from
side to side after the fashion of a miniature panther.
When I stooped to stroke him, he eluded my hand.
In a gliding run, body crouched, ears flattened, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
sped toward the doorway, was through it and gone.</p>

<p>Well, I decided, he could not be pursued all
through the house. It would be easier to explain
him to Phillida next morning. I was tired; pleasantly
tired. The day had been filled with the enthusiasm
and congratulations of my associates, with
conferences and plans for launching the new music
via theatres and advertising. It ought to "go big,"
they assured me. In my optimism of mood, I wondered
if I had not already driven off the Dark Thing,
since the girl had come to me the night past without
It appearing before or afterward. Perhaps, woman-timid,
she exaggerated the danger and It had retreated
after the second failure to overpower me.</p>

<p>I fell asleep with a tranquil conviction that nothing
would disturb my rest this night.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Stillness enveloped me, absolute, desolate. Silence
contained me. Yet the thought of another scorched
against my understanding in a burning communication
of intelligence.</p>

<p>"Man," It commanded, "I am here. Fear!"</p>

<p>And I knew that which was my body did fear to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the point of death, but that which was myself stood
up in revolt.</p>

<p>"Crouch," It bade. "Crouch, pygmy, and beg.
Fear! The blood crawls in the veins, the heart
checks, the nerves shrink and wither&mdash;man, your life
wanes thin and faint. Down&mdash;shall your race
affront mine?"</p>

<p>My heart did stagger and beat slow. Life crept
a sluggish current. But there was another force that
stiffened to resistance, and gathered itself to compact
strength within me.</p>

<p>"No," my thought refused the dark intelligence.
"I am not yours. Command your own, not me."</p>

<p>"Weakling, you have touched that which is mine.
Into my path you have dared step. Back&mdash;for in
my breath you die!"</p>

<p>The air my lungs drew in was foul and poisonous.
With more and more difficulty my heart labored.
Confused memories came to me of men found dead
in their beds in haunted rooms. Would morning
find me so? Better that way than to yield to the
Thing! Better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I struggled erect; or fancied so.</p>

<p>Now I saw myself as one who stood with folded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
arms fronting a breach in a colossal wall. Huge,
immeasurably huge that cliff reared itself beyond
the sight and ranged away on either side into unknown
distances, dully glistening like gray ice,
unbroken save in this place. The gray strand on
which I stood was a narrow strip following the foot
of the wall. Behind me lay a vast, unmoving ocean
banked over with an all-concealing mist. Not a
ripple stirred along that weird beach, or a ray changed
the fixed gray twilight. And I was afraid, for my
danger was not of the common dangers of mankind,
but that which freezes the blood of man when he
draws near the supernatural; the ancient fear.</p>

<p>I stood there, while sweat poured painfully from
me, and fronted my enemy who pressed me hard.</p>

<p>The Thing was at the breach, couched in the
great cleft that split the Barrier, darkness within
darkness. Unseen, I felt the glare of Its hate beat
upon me. From It emanated deathly cold, like the
nearness of an iceberg in the night, with an odor of
damp and mold.</p>

<p>"Puny earth-dweller, lost here," Its menace
breathed, "what keeps you from destruction? For
you the circle has not been traced nor the pentagram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
fixed, for you no law has been thrust down. Trespass
is death. Die, then."</p>

<p>Only my will held It from me, and I felt that
will reel in sickened bewilderment. I had no strength
to answer, only the steadfast instinct to oppose.</p>

<p>The Thing did not pass. There in the breach
It ravened for me, thrust Itself toward me, pressed
against the thin veil of separation between us. I saw
nothing, yet knew where It raised Itself, gigantic in
formlessness more dreadful than any shape. Its
whispered threats broke against me like an evil surf.</p>

<p>"Man, the prey is mine. Would you challenge
me? The woman is mine by the pact of centuries.
Save yourself. Escape."</p>

<p>The woman? Startled wonder filled me. Was
I then fighting for Desire Michell?</p>

<p>Out of the air I was answered as if her voice
had spoken; certainty came to grip me as if with her
small hands. She had no help but in me. If I fell,
she fell. If I stood firm&mdash;&mdash;? Exultant resolve
flared strong and high within me. My will to protect
leaped forward.</p>

<p>The Thing shrank. It dwindled back through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the gap in the Barrier. But as It fled, a last venomous
message drifted to me:</p>

<p>"Again! And again! Tire but once,
pygmy&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I was sitting up in bed in my lighted room, my
fingers clutching the chain of the lamp beside me.
Was some dark bulk just fading from beyond my
window? Or was I still dreaming?</p>

<p>I was trembling with cold, drenched as with
water so that my relaxing hand made a wet mark
on the table beneath the lamp. This much might
have been caused by nightmare. But what sane man
had nightmares like these?</p>

<p>When I was able, I rose, changed to dry garments
and wrapped myself in a heavy bathrobe. There
was an electric coffee service in my room kept for
occasions when I worked late into the night. I
made strong black coffee now and drank it as near
boiling as practicable. Presently the blood again
moved warmly in my veins.</p>

<p>Then I knew that the chill in the room was not
a delusion of my chilled body. I was warm, yet
the air around me remained moist and cold, unlike a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
summer night. It seemed air strangely thickened
and soiled, as pure water may be muddied by the
passage of some unclean body. In this atmosphere
persisted a fetid smell of mold and decay, warring
with the homely scent of coffee and the fragrance of
the pomander beneath my pillow.</p>

<p>I was more shaken, more exhausted by this encounter
with the unknown than by either of my former
experiences. A fact which drove home the
grim farewell of my enemy! <i>Tire but once,
pygmy&mdash;&mdash;!</i> Desire herself had foretold that the
dark Thing would wear me down.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps! But not without fighting for Its
victory. At least I would be no supine victim. Already
I had forced my way&mdash;where? Where was
that Barrier before which I had stood? Awe sank
coldly through me at memory of that colossal land
where I was pygmy indeed, an insolent human intruder
upon the unhuman. What other shapes of
dread stalked and watched beyond that titanic
wall? By what swollen conceit could I hope to win
against Them?</p>

<p>I would not consider escape by flight, even if the
end had been certain destruction. But my head sank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to my hands beneath the weight of a profound depression
and discouragement.</p>

<p>It was the hour before dawn, traditionally the
worst for man. The hour superstition sets apart for
its own, when the life flame burns lowest. At a
distance a dog had treed some little wood creature,
and bayed monotonously.</p>

<p>There was a weakness at the core of my strength.
I waged this combat for the sake of Desire Michell.
<i>But what was she to whom the Thing laid claim by
the pact of centuries?</i></p>

<p>Darkness began to tinge with light. Pale gray
filtered into the dusk with grudging slowness. As
day approached I saw that a fog enfolded the house
in vapor, stealing into the room in coils and swirls
like thin smoke. The lamps looked sickly and dim.
I forced away my languor, rose and walked to the
nearest window.</p>

<p>Something was moving up the slope from the
lake; a dim shape about which the fog clung in steamy
billows. My shaken nerves thrilled unpleasantly.
What stirred at this empty hour? What should loom
so tall?</p>

<p>A moment later the figure was near enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
be distinguished as Ethan Vere, bearing several long
fishing-rods over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Vere!" I hailed him, with mingled relief and
utter disgust with myself. "Anything going on
so early?"</p>

<p>He looked up at me&mdash;I never saw Vere startled&mdash;and
came on to stop beneath the window. Taking off
his cap, he ran his fingers through his black curls,
pushing their wetness from his forehead. I noticed
how the mists painted him with a spectral pallor.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Locke," he greeted me.
"Just as I've been thinking, there are some big snapping-turtles
about the lake and creek. I guessed
there'd be some war between them and me before that
water was safe for use! One of the fellows dragged
a duck under, drowned it and started feeding right
before my eyes, just now."</p>

<p>"We will have to get a canoe."</p>

<p>He nodded placid assent.</p>

<p>"That'll look pretty on the lake. Phillida will
like it. But I guess I'll keep a homely old flat-bottomed
punt out of sight around some corner for
work. The other craft goes over too prompt for jobs
like mine, and don't hold enough. I'm going to fetch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
my rifle, now. I'd admire to blow that duck-eater's
ugly head off."</p>

<p>"I will get into some clothes and be right with
you," I invited myself to the hunt.</p>

<p>"I'd like to have you," he replied with his quaint
politeness. There were times when I could visualize
Vere's New England mother as if I had known her.</p>

<p>The human interlude had been enough to dispel
the black humors of the night. When I was ready to
go out, I opened the drawer that held the copper-bronze
braid and took it into my hand. How vital
with youth its crisp resilience felt in my clasp, I
thought; young, too, were its luxuriance and shining
color. Nonsense, indeed, to fancy ghostliness here
or the passing of musty centuries over the head that
had worn this tress! A flood of reassurance rose
high in me. Whatever the Thing might be, I would
trust the girl Desire Michell. Yes, and for her I
would stand fast at that Barrier until victory declared
for the enemy or for me. Until It passed me, It
should not reach her.</p>

<p>I went downstairs to join Vere. The brightening
mist was cool and fresh. There was neither horror
nor defeat in the promise of the morning.</p>

"In vain I called on Rest to come and stay.<br />
We were but seated at the festival<br />

<span style="margin-left:9.5em;">&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">Rose Garden of Sa'adi.</span><br />
</p></div>


<p>Now I entered a time of experiences differing at
every point, yet interwoven closely, so that my days
might compare to a rope whose strands are of violently
contrasted colors. The rope would be inharmonious,
startling to the eye, but strong to bind
and hold. As I was bound and held!</p>

<p>All day I lived in the wholesome household
atmosphere evoked by Vere and Phillida. It is impossible
to describe the sunny charm they created
about the commonplace. Our gay, simple breakfasts
where Phillida presided in crisp middy blouse
or flowered smock; where the gray cat sat on the
arm of Vere's chair, speculative yellow eye observant
of his master's carving, while the Swedish Cristina
served us her good food with the spice of an occasional
comment on farm or neighborhood events&mdash;how
perfect a beginning for the day! How stale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
beside our breeze-swept table was any board at which
I had ever sat! I do declare that I have never seen
a more winning face than the bright one of my little
cousin whom her world had pronounced "plain."
Vere and I basked in her sunbeams gratefully.</p>

<p>Afterward, we each had our work. Of the three,
Vere was the most industrious; slow, steady and unsparing
of himself to a degree that accomplished
surprising results. Phillida flitted over the place
indoors and out, managing the house, following Vere
about, driving to village or town with me on purchasing
trips for our supplies. I did rather more of my
own work than usual, that summer, and consequently
had more of the commercial side to employ me.</p>

<p>A healthy, normal life? Yes&mdash;until the hours
between midnight and dawn.</p>

<p>I never knew when I laid down at night whether
I should sleep until sun and morning overlay the
countryside; whether the whispering call of Desire
Michell would summon me to an hour more exquisite
than reality, less satisfying than a dream, or whether
I should leap into consciousness of the Loathsome
Eyes fixed coldly malignant upon me while my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
enemy's inhuman hate groped toward me across the
darkness Its presence fouled.</p>

<p>For my two guests kept their promises.</p>

<p>If I speak briefly of the coming of the Thing
during this time, I do so because the mind shrinks
from past pain. It came again, and again. It
craftily used the torture of irregularity in Its coming.
For days there might be a respite, then It would
haunt me nights in succession until my physical endurance
was almost spent.</p>

<p>I have stood before the breach in that Barrier,
fighting that nightmare duel, until the place of colossal
desolation, last frontier the human race might
hope to keep, became as well known to me as a landscape
on earth. Yet the effect of the Thing's
assaults upon me never lessened. On the contrary,
the horror gained in strength. A dreadful familiarity
grew between It and me. Communication flowed
more readily between us with use. I will not set
down, perhaps I dare not set down the intolerable
wickedness of Its alternate menaces and offered
bribes. Contact with Its intelligence poisoned.</p>

<p>There were nights when It was dumb, when all
Its monstrous power concentrated and bore upon me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Its will to destroy locked with my will. My victory
was that I lived.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the shadow, Desire Michell and I drew closer
to one another.</p>

<p>How can I tell of a love that grew without sight?
So much of the love of romance and history is a
matter of flower-petal complexions, heart-consuming
eyes, satin lips, and all the form and color that make
beauty. How can I make clear a love that grew
strong and passionately demanding, knew delicate
coquetries of advance and evasion, intimacy of minds
like the meeting of eyes in understanding&mdash;all in the
dark? The blind might comprehend. But the blind
have a physical communication we had not; touch
has enchantments of its own.</p>

<p>Every night, near midnight, I switched off the
lights and waited in the chair at my writing-table,
where I was accustomed to work. If she had not
come by two o'clock, I learned to know she would
not visit me that night. I might sleep in that certainty.
A strange tryst I kept there in the dark;
listening to the flow of the waterfall from the lake,
loud in that dead hour's stillness, or hearing the soft,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
incessant sounds of insect life awake in trees and
fields. If she came&mdash;a drift of perfume, a movement
slight as a curtain stirred by the wind, then an
hour with such a companion as the ancient magician
might have drawn out of the air to his nine
mystic lamps.</p>

<p>Strange, fantastic tales she told me, spun of
fancies luminous and frail as threads of glass. She
could not speak without betraying her deep learning
in sciences rejected and forgotten by the modern
world. Alchemy, astrology, geomancy furnished
her speech with allusions blank to my ignorance;
which she most gently and politely enlightened when
I confessed. I learned that the Green Lion of Paracelsus
was not a beast, but a recipe for making gold;
that Salamandar's Feather was better known today
as asbestos; and that the Emerald Table was by no
means an article of furniture. I give these examples
merely by way of illustration.</p>

<p>On the other side of the shield held between us,
I soon discovered that she knew no more of modern
city life than a well-taught child who has never left
home. She listened eagerly to accounts of theatres
and restaurants. The history of Phillida and Ethan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Vere seemed to her more moving and wonderful than
any story she could tell me. I was amazed and humbled
to find that she rated my ability to make music
as a lofty art among the occult sciences.</p>

<p>Of the evil Thing that haunted me, we came to
say little. To press her with questions meant to
end her visit, I found by experience. When I spoke
of that strand between the Barrier and the gray mist-hidden
sea, her passion of distress closed all intercourse
with the plea that I go away at once, while
escape was possible, while life remained mine. So
for the most part I curbed my tongue and
my consuming curiosity; not from consideration, but
of necessity.</p>

<p>One night I asked her how the dark Thing spoke
to me, by what medium of communication.</p>

<p>"Spirits of all orders can speak to man in every
language, so long as they are face to face," she answered,
with a faint surprise at my lack of knowledge.
"'<i>When they turn to man, they come into
use of his language and no longer remember their
own, but as soon as they turn from man they resume
their own language, and forget his.</i>'</p>

<p>"But they themselves are unaware of this fact,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
for they utter thought to thought by direct intelligence.
So if angel or demon turns his back to you,
Roger, you may not make him hear you though you
call with great force."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, Desire?"</p>

<p>"But by simple reading! Do not Ennemoser
and many writers record it?"</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to such beings, Desire?"</p>

<p>The question was rash, but it escaped me before
I could check the impulse. To my relief, she answered
without resentment:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"No? The Thing&mdash;the enemy that comes to
me has never spoken to you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>I was silent in amazement and incredulity. The
dark creature claimed her, she declared herself helpless
to escape from that dominion into normal life,
and yet It never had spoken to her? It spoke to me,
a stranger most ignorant, and not to the seeress who
was familiar with Its existence and the lore which
linked humanity to Its fearful kind?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"You do not believe me," her voice came quietly
across my thoughts.</p>

<p>"I believe you, of course," I stammered. "I
was only&mdash;astonished. You have described It, and
the Barrier, so often; from the first night&mdash;&mdash;! I
supposed you had seen all I have, and more."</p>

<p>"All you have seen? Now tell me with what
eyes you have seen the Barrier and the Far Frontier?
The eyes of the body, or that vision by which man
sees in a dream and which is to the sight as the speech
of spirits is to the hearing?"</p>

<p>"I suppose&mdash;with the inner sight."</p>

<p>"Then understand me when I say that I have
seen with the eyes of another, by a sight not mine
and yet my own."</p>

<p>"You mean," I floundered in vague doubts and
jealousy of her human associations of which I knew
nothing. "You mean&mdash;hypnotism?"</p>

<p>She laughed with half-sad raillery.</p>

<p>"How shall I answer you, Roger? Once upon a
time, the jewel called beryl was thought unrivaled as
a mirror into which a magician might look to see
reflected events taking place at a distance, or reflections
of the future. But by and by magicians grew
wiser. They found any crystal would serve as well
as a beryl. Later still, they found a little water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
poured in a basin or held in the hollow of the hand
showed as true a fantasm. So one wrote: '<i>There is
neither crystallomancy nor hydromancy, but the
magick is in the Seer himself.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Well, Desire?"</p>

<p>"Well, Roger&mdash;if to see with the sight of another
is hypnotism, then every man who writes a
book or tells a good tale is a hypnotist; every historian
who makes us see the past is a necromancer."</p>

<p>"You read of the Thing&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, after a long pause. "I knew
It through sympathy with one who died as I would
not have you to die, my friend Roger, of whom I
shall think long in that place to which I go presently.
Question me no more. When the time comes for you
to throw a certain braid of hair and a pomander
into the fire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will never do that!"</p>

<p>"No? Well, you might keep the pomander,
which is pure gold engraved with ancient signs and
the name of the Shining Dawn, Dahana, in Sanskrit
characters. Also the perfume it contains is precious,
being blent with the herb vervain which is powerful
against evil spirits."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>"It is not the pomander that I should keep, nor
the pomander that holds the powerful spell."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;value the braid so much?"</p>

<p>"I value only one other beauty as highly."</p>

<p>"Yes, Roger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Desire. And that beauty is she who wore
the braid."</p>

<p>Now the darkness in the room was dense. Yet
I thought I sensed a movement toward me as airy as
the flutter of a bird's wing. The fragrance in the
atmosphere eddied as if stirred by her passing. But
when I spoke to her again, after a moment's waiting,
she had gone.</p>

<p>I am sure no housekeeper was ever more nice in
her ideas of neatness than my little Cousin Phillida,
and no maid more exact in carrying out orders than
Cristina. Nevertheless, automobiles pass on the
quietest roads, and my windows are always wide
open. There is the fireplace, too, with possibilities of
soot. Anyhow, there was a light gray dust overlaying
the writing-table on the following morning. And
in the dust was a print as if a small hand had rested
there, a yard from my chair.</p>

<p>A slim hand it must have been. I judged the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
palm had been daintily cupped, the fingers slender,
smooth and long in proportion to the absurd size of
the whole affair. My hand covered it without brushing
an outline.</p>

<p>I could not put this souvenir away with the braid
and the pomander. But I could put its evidence with
their witness of Desire Michell's reality.</p>

</p></div>


<p>Now I have to record how I walked into the
oldest snare in the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the sense of her near presence
brought home to me by her hand-print on the table
so close to where my hand rested; perhaps it was her
speech of presently leaving me to return no more.
Or perhaps both these joined in urging on my determination
to learn more of Desire Michell before
some unknown bar fell between us. I only know
that I passed into a mood of trapped exasperation
at my helplessness and lack of knowledge. It seemed
imperative that I should act to save us both, act
soon and surely; yet inaction was bound upon me
by my ignorance. Who was she? Where did she
live? What bond held her subject to the Thing
from the Barrier? What gates were to close between
us? Why could she not put her hand in mine, any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
night, and let me take her away from this haunted
place? Why, at least, not come to me in the light,
and let me see her face to face? I was a man groping
in a labyrinth while outside something precious to
him is being stolen.</p>

<p>For the first time I found myself unable to work,
unable to share our household life with Phillida
and Vere, or to find relaxation in driving about the
countryside. Anger against Desire herself stirred at
the bottom of my mind; Desire, who hampered me
by the word of honor in which she had netted me
so securely.</p>

<p>It was then that my enemy from the unknown
places began to whisper of the book.</p>

<p>I encountered that enemy in a new mood. We
did not meet at the breach in the mighty wall, confronted
in death conflict between Its will and mine.
Instead, night after night It crept to my window as
at our first meeting. I started awake to find Its
awful presence blackening the starlight where It
crouched opposite me, Its intelligence breathing
against mine. As always, my human organism
shrank from Its unhuman neighborhood. Chill and
repugnance shook my body, while that part of me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
which was not body battled against nightmare
paralysis of horror. But now It did not menace or
strive against me. It displayed a dreadful suavity
I might liken to the coiling and uncoiling of those
great snakes who are reported to mesmerize their
prey by looping movements and figures melting from
change to change in the Hunger Dance of Kaa.</p>

<p>There was a book that held all I longed to know,
It whispered to me. A book telling of the woman!
She did not wish me to read, for fear I should grow
overwise and make her mine. The book was here,
in my house. I might arise and find&mdash;if I would be
guided by It&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>I thrust the whispers away. How could I trust
my enemy? If such a book existed, which seemed
improbable, there was a taint of disloyalty to Desire
in the thought of reading without her knowledge.</p>

<p>The Thing was not turned away. How could
I do harm by learning what she was, unless she had
evil to conceal? Did I fear to know the truth? As
for the book's existence, I had only to accept guidance
from It&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>I persisted in refusal. But the idea of the book
followed me through my days like a wizard's familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
dogging me. Where could such a volume be hidden,
in what secret nook in wall or floor? How came a
book to be written about the girl I supposed young,
unknown and set apart from the world? Was I
letting slip an opportunity by my fastidious notions
of delicacy?</p>

<p>Indecision and curiosity tormented me beyond
rest. Phillida and Vere began to consider me with
puzzled eyes. Cristina developed a habit of cooking
individual dishes of especial succulence and triumphantly
setting them before me as a "surprise"; a
kindness which of course obliged me to eat whether
I was hungry or not. I suspect my little cousin
abetted her in this transparent ruse. I pleaded the
heat as an excuse for all. We were in late August
now. Cicadas sang their dry chant in the fields,
where the sun glared down upon Vere's crops and
painted him the fine bronze of an Indian. Our lake
scarcely stirred under the hot, still air.</p>

<p>It was after a day of such heat, succeeded by a
night hardly more cool, that the lights in my room
quietly went out. I was sitting at my table, some
letters which required answers spread before me
while I brooded, pen between my fingers, upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
mystery which had become my life. For the moment
I attributed the sudden failure of light to some accident
at the powerhouse.</p>

<p>Not for long! The hateful cold that crept like
freezing vapor into the room, the foul air of damp
and corruption pouring into the scented country
atmosphere, the frantic revolt of body and nerves&mdash;before
I turned my eyes to the window I knew the
monster from the Frontier crouched there.</p>

<p>"Weakling!" It taunted me. "Puny from of
old, how should you prevail? By your fear, the
woman stays mine. Miserable earth-crawler, in
whose hand the weapon was laid and who shrinking
let it fall unused, the end comes."</p>

<p>"The book?" I gasped, against my better
judgment.</p>

<p>"The book was the weapon."</p>

<p>"No, or you would not have offered it to me."</p>

<p>"Coward, believe so. Hug the belief while you
may. The offer is past."</p>

<p>Past? A madness of bafflement and frustrated
curiosity gripped and shook me.</p>

<p>"I take the offer," I cried in passion and defiance.
"If there is such a book, show it to me!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>The Thing was gone. Light quietly filled the
lamps&mdash;or was it that I had opened my eyes? I
gripped the arms of my chair, waiting. For what?
I did not know. Only, all the horror I ever had felt
in the presence of the Thing was slight compared to
the fear that presently began to flow upon me as an
icy current. There in the pleasantly lighted room,
alone, I sank through depths of dread, down into
an abyss of despair, down&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A long sigh of rising wind passed through the
house like a sucked breath of triumph. Windows
and doors drew in and out against their frames with
a rattling crash, then hung still with unnatural
abruptness. Absolute stillness succeeded. I felt a
very slight shock, as if the ground at my feet
was struck.</p>

<p>I fled from the terror for the first time. Yes,
coward at last, deserter from that unseen Frontier's
defense, I found myself in the hall outside my room,
leaning sick and faint against the wall. Behind me
the door shut violently, yet I felt no current of air
to move it.</p>

<p>From the other side of the house there sounded
the click of latch, then a patter of soft-shod feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Phillida came hurrying down the hall toward me.
She was wrapped in some silky pink-flowered garment.
Her short hair stood out around her head like
a little girl's well-brushed crop. She presented as
endearingly natural a figure, I thought, as any man
could seek or imagine. The wisdom of Ethan Vere
who had garnered his love here!</p>

<p>"Cousin?" she exclaimed. "The hall light is
so dim! You almost frightened me when I glimpsed
you standing there. Did the wind wake you, too?
I think we are going to have a thunder storm, it is so
hot and gusty. I heard poor Bagheera mewing and
scratching at the door, so I was just going down to
let him in before the rain comes."</p>

<p>"Yes," I achieved. Then, finding my voice secure:
"I will let in the cat. Where is Vere?"</p>

<p>"He did not wake up, so I tiptoed out. Why?"</p>

<p>"I do not like to have you going about the house
alone at this hour."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened and she laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Why, Cousin Roger! What a funny idea to
have about our very own house! I have one of the
electric flashlights you bought for us all; see?"</p>

<p>What could I tell her of my vision of her womanly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
softness and timidity brought to bay by the Thing
of horror, down in those empty lower rooms? How
did I know It stalked no prey but me? Its clutch
was upon Desire Michell. These were Its hours,
between midnight and dawn.</p>

<p>"Tramps," I explained evasively. "Give me
the light."</p>

<p>But she pattered down the stairs beside me,
kimono lifted well above her pink-flowered slippers,
one hand on the balustrade. The light glinted in the
white topaz that guarded her wedding ring, a richer
jewel than any diamond in the sight of one who
knew the tender thought with which she had set it
there. No! The horror was not for her, clothed in
her wholesome goodness as in armor of proof.
Surely for such as she the Barrier stood unbreached
and strong.</p>

<p>When I opened the front door, Bagheera darted
in like a hunted cat. A drift of mist entered with
him. Looking out, I saw the night was heavy with
a low-hanging fog that scarcely rose to the tree tops; a
ground-mist that eddied in smoke-like waves of gray
where our light fell upon it. Such mists were common
here, yet I shivered and shut it out with relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
While I refastened the lock, Bagheera purred around
my ankles, pressing caressingly against me as if
thanking me after the manner of cats. I remembered
this was not the first time he had shown this
anxiety and gratitude for shelter.</p>

<p>"Bagheera does love you," Phillida commented,
stooping to pat him. "Isn't it funny, though, that he
never will go into your room? He is always petting
around you downstairs. When Cristina or I are
doing up your quarters, he will follow us right up
to the door-sill, but we can't coax him inside. Perhaps
he doesn't like that perfume you always
have about."</p>

<p>A qualm ran through me, recalling the night I
had taken the cat there by force and its frantic
escape. But I snapped the key fast and straightened
myself with sharp self-contempt. Had I fallen so
low as to heed the caprices of a pet cat? Was it not
enough that I had fled from my enemy after accepting
the knowledge It had striven so long to force
upon me?</p>

<p>For I had that knowledge. When I had halted in
the passage outside my room, in the moment before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Phillida had joined me, there had been squarely set
before my mental sight the place to seek the book.</p>

<p>"Phillida, there was a bookcase in this house
when it was bought," I said. "I believe it stood in
my room before the place was altered. A small
stand; I remember putting my candle on its top the
first night I slept here. Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>Some tone in my question seemed to touch her
expression with surprise as she lifted her eyes to
mine; or perhaps it was the hour I chose for
the inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered readily. "I supposed
you had noticed it long ago; I mean, where it stands.
The quaintest bit, a genuine antique! And holding
the stuffiest collection of old books, too! I believe
they may be valuable, out-of-print, early editions.
If," her voice faltered wistfully, "if Father ever
forgives me for being happy with Ethan, and
comes to visit us, he would love every musty
old volume. Do you think Mother and he ever will,
Cousin Roger?"</p>

<p>"I am sure they will, Phil. Feuds and tragic
parents are out of date. They must adjust themselves
gradually when they realize Vere is&mdash;himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Before you go upstairs to him, will you tell me where
to find that bookcase?"</p>

<p>"Now? Why, of course!"</p>

<p>She led me across the hall to her sewing room.
I cannot say that she sewed there very much, but she
had chosen that title in preference to boudoir or study
as more becoming a housewife. She had assembled
here a spinning-wheel from the attic, some samplers,
a Hepplewhite sewing-table and chairs discovered
about the house. Her canaries' cage hung
above a great punch-bowl of flowered ware in which
she kept gold-fish. A pipe of Vere's balanced beside
the bowl showed that his masculine presence
was not excluded.</p>

<p>In a corner stood the bookcase. Phillida pulled
the chain of a lamp bright under a shade of peacock
chintz, and watched me stoop to look at the
faded bindings.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Phil," I said. "It may take some
time to find the book I want. You had better hurry
back to bed before Vere comes hunting for a
missing wife."</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay and hunt for the book
tonight, then?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>"Unless you are afraid I shall disturb your
canaries?"</p>

<p>She did not laugh. Drawing nearer, she stroked
my sleeve with a caressing doubt and remonstrance.</p>

<p>"But you have not been to bed at all, and soon
it will be morning! Do you have to write your lovely
music at night, Cousin Roger? You have been
growing thin and tired, this summer. Are you quite
well? You are so good that you should be happy,
but&mdash;are you?"</p>

<p>"Good, Phil?" I wondered, touched. "Why,
how did your lazy, tune-spinning, frivolous cousin
get that reputation in this branch of the family?"</p>

<p>"You are so kind," she said simply. "Ethan
says so. You know, Cousin Roger, that I was over-educated
in my childhood; my brain choked with
little, little stupid knowledge that hardly matters at
all. We went to church Sundays because that was
the correct thing to do. But I was almost a heathen
when Ethan married me. He doesn't trouble about
church. He doesn't trouble about the past, or life
after death, or punishment for sin. He believes if
one tries to be kind and straight, the big Kindness
and Straightness takes care of everything. So I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
learned to feel that way, too. It is a&mdash;a calm sort
of feeling all the time, if you know what I mean.
And that is the way you are good, although perhaps
you never thought of it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Phillida," I acknowledged; and
walked with her to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>When her pink-clad figure had vanished behind
her bedroom door, I went back to the sewing room
and drew up a chair before the case of books.</p>

<p>Phillida had not unreasonably stigmatized them
as stuffy. They were a sober collection. Burton's
"Anatomy of Melancholy," an ancient copy of the
Apocrypha, and a three-volume Life of Martin
Luther loaded the first shelf. I looked at the second
shelf and found it filled with the bound sermons of
a divine of whom I had never heard.</p>

<p>The lowest shelf held strange companions for the
sedate volumes above. Erudite works on theosophy,
magic, the interpretation of dreams and demonology
huddled together here. Not all of them were readable
by my humble store of learning. There was a
Latin copy of Artemidorus, Mesmer's "Shepherd,"
Mathew Paris, some volumes in Greek, and some
I judged to be Arabian and Hebrew. At the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the row stood a thin, dingy book whose title had
passed out of legibility. I took it out and opened
the covers.</p>

<p>Fronting the first page was a faded woodcut, the
portrait of a woman. Beneath in old long-s type,
dim on the yellowed paper, was printed the legend:</p>

<p>"<i>Desire Michell, ye foul<sup>e</sup> witch.</i>"</p>

<p>Closing the book, I forced reason to come forward.
I was resolved that panic should not drive me
again nor my defense fall from within its walls.
Master of my enemy I might never be; master of my
own inner kingdom I must and should be. But I was
glad to be here instead of upstairs while I read;
glad of the interlude in Phillida's company, and of
the presence of the three sleepy canaries who blinked
down at the disturbing lamp.</p>

<p>The date stamped into the back of the book in
Roman numerals was of a year in the seventeen hundreds.
What connection could its Desire Michell
have with the girl I knew? Perhaps she had adopted
the name to mystify me. Or at most, she might
be of the family of that unfortunate woman branded
witch by a bigoted generation.</p>

<p>Reopening the book, I studied the dim, stiff por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>trait.
The face was young, delicate of line, with long
eyes set wide apart; eyes that even in this wretched
picture kept a curious drowsy watchfulness. The
inevitable white Puritan cap was worn, but curls
clustered about the brow and two massive braids
descended over either shoulder. The perfumed
bronze-colored braid up in my drawer&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The volume was entitled "Some Manifestations
of Satan in Witchcraft in Ye Colonies," by Abimelech
Fetherstone. Disregarding the satanic manifestations
set forth in the other four chronicles, I
turned to "Ye Foul<sup>e</sup> Witch, Desire Michell."</p>

<p>As I began to read, another breath of wind sighed
through the house, sucking windows and doors in
and out with the shock of sound, instantly ended, that
is produced by a distant explosion. I thought a
flash of lightning whipped across my eyes. But
when I glanced toward the windows I saw only
the smoke-like fog banked in drifts against the panes.</p>

<p>I will tear the core out of many yellow pages
of diffuse writing spiced with smug moral reflections.</p>

<p>Desire Michell had been no traditional old hag,
hideous and malevolent; no pallid, raving epileptic to
accuse herself in shrieking tales of Black Men, and
Sabbats, and harm done to neighbors' cattle or crops.
Her father was a clergyman who brought his goods
and his motherless daughter from England to the
Colonies, and settled in "ye Pequot Marsh country."
There he found a congregation, and they lived much
respected. Their culture appeared to be far beyond
that of their few, hard-working neighbors. Young
Mistress Michell was reputed learned in the use of
simples, among other arts, and to have been "of a
beauty exceeding the custom among godly women, to
so great degree that sorcery should have been suspected
of her."</p>

<p>However, sorcery was not suspected; not even
when her fame spread among near-dwelling Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
tribes who gave her a name signifying <i>Water on
which the Sun is Shining</i>. Admiration was her portion,
then, with all the suitors the vicinity held. But
from fastidiousness or ambition she refused every
proposal made to her father for her. She walked
aloof and alone, until another sort of wooer came to
the gate of the minister's house.</p>

<p>This man's full name was not given, apparently
through the writer's cautious respect for place and
influence. He was vaguely described as goodly in
appearance, of high family, but not abundantly supplied
with riches. However he chanced to come to the
obscure settlement was not stated. He did come,
saw Desire Michell, and fell as abjectly prostrate
before her as any youth who never had left
the village.</p>

<p>He pressed his courtship hard and eagerly. At
first he was welcome at the minister's house. But
a day came when Master Michell forbade him to
cross that door and rumor whispered, scandalized,
that Sir Austin's suit had not been honorable to
the maid.</p>

<p>Sir Austin sulked a week at the village inn. Then
he broke under the torment of not seeing Desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Michell. Their betrothal was made public, and he
rode away to prepare his home for their marriage in
the spring.</p>

<p>Travel was slow in the winter, news trickled
slowly across snowbound distances. With spring
came no bridegroom; instead word arrived of his
affair with an heiress recently come to New York
from England. She was rich in gold and grants
of land from the Crown. Her husband would be
a man of weight and influence, it seemed.</p>

<p>Sir Austin had married her.</p>

<p>Desire Michell shut herself in her father's house.
The clergyman did not live many months after the
humiliation. Alone, the girl lived. "Student,"
wrote Abimelech Fetherstone, "of black and bitter
arts. Or as some say, having, like Bombastus de
Hohenheim, a devil's bird enchained to do her will."</p>

<p>In his distant home, Sir Austin sickened. He
burned with fever, anguish consumed him. Physicians
were called to the bedside of the rich man.
They could not diagnose his ailment or help him. He
screamed for water. When it was brought, his
throat locked and he could not swallow. He raved
of Desire Michell, beseeching her mercy. In his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
times of sanity, he begged and commanded his wife
and servants to send for the girl. In her pardon
he saw his sole hope of life.</p>

<p>Finally, he was obeyed. Messengers were sent
to the village. They were not even admitted to the
house they sought, or to sight of Mistress Michell.</p>

<p>"Your master came himself to woo; let him
come himself to plead."</p>

<p>That was the answer they received to carry back
to the sick man.</p>

<p>Sir Austin heard, and submitted with trembling
hope. Writhing in the anguish wasting him by day
and night, he made the journey by coach and litter
to Desire Michell's house. At her door-sill he implored
entrance and pity. The door did not open.</p>

<p>It never opened for him. For three days in succession
he was borne to her threshold, calling on her
in his pain and fear. His servants and physician
clustered about staring at the house which stood
locked and blank of response. At night fire-shine
was seen from an upper room; some declared they
heard wild, melodious laughter.</p>

<p>On the third day Sir Austin died. A stern-faced
deputation of men went to the house of the late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
clergymen. They found the door unlatched and
open to their entrance. In the upper room they
found Mistress Michell seated before her hearth
where a dying fire fell to embers, her hair "flowing
down in grate bewty."</p>

<p>"What have I to do with Sir Austin, or he with
me?" she calmly asked the men who gaped upon her.
"How should I have harmed him, who came not near
him, as ye know? Bury him, and leave me in peace."</p>

<p>If she had been aged and ugly, she might have
been hung. Gossip ran rife through the countryside.
But indignation was strong against the man who had
jilted the local beauty, there existed no proof of harm
done, and the matter slept for a time.</p>

<p>New matters came. A horror grew up around
the house. The girl was seen flitting across the fields
at dawn, a monstrous shadow following. Her voice
was heard from the room where she locked herself
alone, raised in unknown speech. Strange lights
moved in her windows in the deep night. The old
woman who had served in the house for years was
stricken with a palsy and was taken away mumbling
unintelligible things that iced the blood of superstitious
hearers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>There was a young man of the neighborhood
whose love for Mistress Michell had been long and
constant. One morning he was found dead on her
doorstep, his face fixed in drawn terror. Under his
hand four words were scrawled in the snow: "<i>Sara
daughter of Ruel&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>There were those who could finish that quotation.
Next Sabbath the new minister took as his text: "Ye
shall not suffer a witch to live." And he spoke of
Sara the daughter of Ruel, who was wed to ten
bridegrooms, each of whom was dead on the wedding
eve; for she was beloved by an evil spirit that
suffered none to come to her. Authority moved at
last against Desire Michell. But when the officers
came to arrest her, she was found dead in her favorite
seat before the hearth.</p>

<p>"Fair and upright in her place, scented with a
perfume she herself distilled of her learning in such
matters; which was said to contain a rare herb of
Jerusalem called Lady's Rose, resembling spikenard,
with vervain and cedar and secret simples; in which
she steeped her hair so that wherever she abode were
sweet odours. So did she escape Justice, but shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
not escape Hell's Damnation and Heaven's casting out."</p>

<p>I closed the book and laid it down.</p>

<p>Reading those dim, closely printed pages had
taken time. I was astonished to find the window
spaces gray with dawn, when I glanced that way.
The night was past. Neither from Desire nor from
the Thing without a name which had sent me to this
book could I find out what I was expected to glean
from the narration.</p>

<p>My enemy had made no conditions on directing
me to the book. It had asked no price, uttered no
menace. Why, then, had I so solemn a certainty
that a crisis in our affair had been reached. I had
come to an end; a corner had been turned. I had
opened a door that could not be closed. How did I
know this? Why?</p>

<p>Why was the fog against the windows this morning
so like the fog that shrouded the unearthly sea
opposite the Barrier?</p>

<p>By and by Cristina came downstairs and busied
herself in the kitchen. Bagheera, who had slept beside
my chair all night, rose and padded out to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
region of breakfast and saucers of milk. Next, the
voices of Phillida and Vere drifted from above.</p>

<p>To have Phillida find me there in her sewing-room,
finishing an all-night vigil, involved too many
explanations. I did an unwise thing. From the
lowest shelf of the bookcase I gathered such books
as were readable by my knowledge, and carried the
armful up to my room. After a hot bath and breakfast
I would look over these companions of the New
England witch book.</p>

</p></div>


<p>The fog stayed all day. The mist was so dense
that it gave the effect of a solid mass enclosing the
house. No wind stirred it, no cheering beam of sun
pierced it. Through it sounds reached the ear distorted
and magnified. All day I sat in my
room reading.</p>

<p>There are books which should not be preserved.
I, who am a lover of books, who detest any form of
censorship, I do seriously set down my belief that
there exist chronicles which would be better destroyed.
With this few people will agree. My answer
to them is simple: they have not read the books
I mean.</p>

<p>Not all the volumes from the old bookcase were
of that character, of course. Nearly all of them were
well known to classical students, at least by name.
Obscure, fantastic, cast aside by the world they were,
but harmless to a fairly steady head. But there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
were two that clung to the mind like pitch. I have
no intention of giving their titles.</p>

<p>Ugly and sullen, early night closed in when I
was in a mood akin to it. Dinner with Phillida
and Vere was an ordeal hurried through. We were
out of touch. I felt remote from them; fenced apart
by a heavy sense of guilt and defilement left by those
hateful books, most incongruously blended with contempt
for my companions' childish light-heartedness.
As soon as possible, I left them.</p>

<p>Alone in my room, in my chair behind the writing-table
again, I pushed aside the pile of books and
sank into sombre thought. What should I say to
Desire Michell if she came tonight?</p>

<p>Who was she, who was claimed by the Unspeakable
and who did not deny Its claim? Was I confronted
with two beings from places unknown to
normal humanity? If she was the woman that she had
seemed to be throughout our intercourse, how could
the dark enemy control her? Even I, a common
man with full measure of mankind's common faults
and weaknesses, could hold Its clutch from me by
right of the law that protects each in his place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>Was she one of those who have stepped from the
permitted places?</p>

<p>"<i>Sara the daughter of Ruel&mdash;who was beloved
by an evil spirit who suffered none to come to her.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>There was a young gentlewoman of excellent
beauty, daughter of a nobleman of Mar, who
loved a foule monstrous thing verie horrible to behold,
and for it refused rich marriages.... Until
the Gospel of St. John being said suddenlie the wicked
spirit flue his waies with sore noise.</i>"</p>

<p>I put out my hand and thrust the pile of books
aside from my direct sight. But I could not so
easily thrust from my mind the thoughts these books
had implanted. I could not forget that Desire
Michell herself had alleged jealousy as the Thing's
reason for attacking me.</p>

<p>What if we came to an explanation tonight and
ended this long delirium? Was it not time? Had
not my weeks of endurance earned me this right?
Resolution mounted in me, defiant and strong.</p>

<p>The evening had passed to an hour when I might
look for the girl to come. I switched off the lights,
and sat down to keep our nightly tryst.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the haunted room, the thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
I would have held at bay rushed upon me as clamorous
besiegers.</p>

<p>Desire! Desire of the world! Desire of mine
and of the unhuman Thing, did we grasp at Eve or
Lilith? At the fire on the hearth or the cold phosphorescence
of swamp and marsh?</p>

<p>A drift of fragrance was afloat on the air. A
delicate stir of movement passed by me. I raised my
head from my hands, expectant.</p>

<p>"I am here," her familiar voice told me.</p>

<p>"Desire, you had to come, tonight."</p>

<p>Some quality in my voice carried to her a message
beyond the words. But she did not break into exclamation
or question as another woman might. She
was mute, as one who stands still to find the path
before taking a step.</p>

<p>"You are angry," she said at last. "Something
here has gone badly for you; I knew that before
I entered this room."</p>

<p>"How can you say that?" I challenged. "If
you are like other men and women, how can you
know what happens when you are absent? How do
you know what passes between the Thing from the
Frontier and me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>"I do not know unless you tell me, Roger. If I
feel from afar when you are in sorrow, why, so do
many people feel with another in sympathy."</p>

<p>"You feel more than ordinary sympathy can,"
I retorted.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps it is not an ordinary sympathy
I have for you, Roger."</p>

<p>Her very gentleness struck wrong on my perverted
mood. Was she trying to turn me from my
purpose with her soft speech? She had never granted
me anything so near an admission of love until now.</p>

<p>"It is not an ordinary trial that I have borne
for these meagre meetings where I do not see your
face or touch your hand," I answered. "But that
must end. Put your hand in mine, Desire, and come
with me. Let us go out of this room where shadows
make our thoughts sickly. You shall stay with my
cousin. Or if you choose, we will go straight to
New York or Boston. I am asking you to be my
wife. Let us have done with phantoms and spectres.
I love you."</p>

<p>"No," she whispered. "You do not love me
tonight. Tonight you distrust me. Why?"</p>

<p>"Is it distrusting you to ask you to marry me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>"Not this way would you have asked that of me
when I last came! But I will answer you more
honestly than you do me. To go with you would be
the greatest happiness the world could give. To
think of it dazzles the heart. But it is not for me.
Have you forgotten, Roger, that my life is not mine?
That I am a prisoner who has crept out for a little
while? The gates soon close, now, upon me."</p>

<p>"What gates?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Sacrifice and expiation."</p>

<p>"Expiation of what?" I exclaimed, exasperated.
"Desire, I have read the book of Desire Michell,
downstairs."</p>

<p>I heard her gasp and shrink in the darkness.
Silence bound us both. In the hush, it seemed to
me that the house suddenly trembled as it had done
the night before, a slight shock as from some distant
explosion. In my intentness upon the woman opposite
me the tremor passed unheeded. She must answer
me now, surely! Now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She spoke with a breathless difficulty, spacing her
words apart:</p>

<p>"How did you&mdash;find&mdash;the book?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>"It told me&mdash;the Thing from out there," I admitted,
sullenly defiant of her opinion.</p>

<p>She cried out sharply.</p>

<p>"You? You took Its gift? You did that fatal
madness&mdash;and you are here? Oh, you are lost, and
the guilt mine! Yet I warned you that danger
flowed from knowing me. You accepted the risk
and the sorrow&mdash;yet you have thrown down all for
a bribe of knowledge. Do you not know what it
means to take a gift from the Dark Ones of the
Borderland? To brave the Loathesome Eyes so
long&mdash;and fall this way at last! Yet&mdash;there may be
a hope&mdash;since you still live. But go. Not tomorrow,
not at dawn, but go now. By all that man can dread
for soul or body, go now."</p>

<p>"Not without you."</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, how can I make you understand! I
shall never come here again. Take with you my
gratitude for our hours together, my prayers for all
the years to come. There is no blame to you because
you could not trust a woman on whom falls the
shadow of the awful Watcher that stalks behind me.
I make no reproach&mdash;if only you will go. Do not
linger. I do most solemnly warn you not to stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
alone in this room one moment after I have gone."</p>

<p>"Desire!" I exclaimed. "Wait. Forgive me.
I trust you. I did not mean what you believe. Do
not leave me this way. Desire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I can say honestly that my next action was without
intention. On my table lay, as usual, a small
electric torch. Every member of our household was
provided with one for use in emergencies likely to
occur in a country house, the time of candles being
past. Now, rising in agitation and repentance, my
hand pressed by chance upon the flashlight's button.
A beam of light poured across the darkness.</p>

<p>What did I see, starting out of the black gloom?
A spirit or a woman? Were those a woman's draperies
or part of the night fog that showed mere swirl
upon swirl of pale gray twisting in the path of light?
I glimpsed a face colorless as pearl, the shine of eyes
dark and almond shaped, then a drifting mass of
gray smoke, all intermingled with glittering gold
flashes, seemed to close between us. The whole
apparition sank down out of vision, as aghast, I
lifted my hand and the torch went out.</p>

<p>Shaken out of all ability to speak, I stood in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
place. Did I hear a movement, or only a stirring
of the orchard trees beyond the windows?</p>

<p>"Desire?" I ventured, my voice hoarse to
my ears.</p>

<p>No answer. I felt myself alone.</p>

<p>I would not at once turn on the lamps. My
haste might seem an attempt to break faith with her
a second time. I sat down again, folding my arms
upon the table and resting my forehead upon them.</p>

<p>Well, I had seen her at last&mdash;but how? A wan
loveliness seemingly painted upon the canvas of the
dark by a brush dipped in moonlight. A white moth
caught fluttering in the ray of the torch. Seen at
the instant of her leaving me forever; insulted by my
suspicions, my love hurled coarsely at her like a
command, my promise of security for her visits
apparently broken. How dared I even hope for
her return?</p>

<p>Now I knew why my enemy had guided me to
those books, that I might read, fill my mind with the
poison of vile thoughts, and destroy the comradeship
that bound me to Desire Michell. How should I
find her? How free us both?</p>

<p>The clock in the hall downstairs struck a single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
bell. With dull surprise I realized that considerable
time had passed while I sat there. Still I did not
move, weighed down by a profound discouragement.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as a wave will run up a beach in
advance of the incoming tide, impelled by some deep
stir in the ocean's secret places, an icy surge rushed
about my feet. Deathly cold from that current struck
through my whole body. My heart shuddered and
staggered in its beating from pure shock.</p>

<p>"<i>Go! Not tomorrow, not at dawn, but now!</i>"</p>

<p>The wave seeped back, receded away from me
down its invisible beach. Desire's warning hammered
at my mind, striving to burst some barred door
to reach the consciousness within that had loitered too
long. This was the new peril. This was what I
had fled from, unknowing the source of my panic,
the night before.</p>

<p>This was death.</p>

<p>A second surge struck me with the heavy shock
of a veritable wave from some bitter ocean. This
time the tide rose to my knees; boiling and hissing in
its rush. Blood and nerves seemed to freeze. I felt
my heart stop, then reel on like a broken thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Flecks of crimson spattered like foam against
my eyelids.</p>

<p>The wave broke. The mass poured down the
beach, tugging at me in its retreat. With the last
strength ebbing away from me with that receding
current, I dragged the chain of the lamp beside me.</p>

<p>The comfort of light springing up in the room!
The relief of seeing normal, pleasant surroundings!
Truly light is an elixir of courage to man.</p>

<p>That cold had paralyzed me. I had no force
to rise. Nor did I altogether wish to rise and go.
I had lost Desire tonight. Was I to lose my self-respect
also? Was I to run a beaten man from this
peril, after standing against my enemy so long?</p>

<p>Should I not rather stand on this my ground
where I was not the "lame feller"?</p>

<p>Down by the lake, the snarling cry of a terrified
cat broke the night stillness. It was Bagheera's
voice. The cry was followed by sounds indicating a
small animal's frantic flight through the thickets of
goldenrod and willow that edged the banks of the
stream below the dam. The series of progressive
crashes passed back of the house and continued on,
dying away down the creek.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>As I braced my startled nerves after this outbreak
of noise, the light was withdrawn from every
lamp in the room. At the same moment, the electric
torch rolled off my table and fell to the floor. I
heard its progress across the muffling softness of the
rug, across the polished wood beyond, and final stoppage
at some point out of my reach.</p>

<p>As vapor rises from some unseen source and
forms in vague growing mass within the curdled air,
so blackening dark the hideous bulk reared Itself in
the night and stared in upon me. As so many times,
I felt the Eyes I could not see; the pressure of a
colossal hate loomed over me, poised to crush, yet
withheld by a force greater than either of us. The
venom of Its malevolence flowed into the atmosphere
about me, fouling the breath I drew. My
lungs labored.</p>

<p>"Pygmy," Its intelligence thrust against mine.
"Frail and presumptuous Will that has dared oppose
mine, you are conquered. This is the hour foretold
to you, the hour of your weakness and my strength.
Weakling, feel the death surf break upon you. Fall
down before me. Cower&mdash;plead!"</p>

<p>Now indeed I felt a sickness of self-doubt, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the wash of the invisible sea never had come to me
until tonight. And there was Desire's saying that
I had destroyed myself by accepting the Thing's gift
of knowledge of the book. But I summoned
my forces.</p>

<p>"Never," my thought refused It. "Have we not
met front to front these many nights? And who
has drawn back, Breaker of the Law? You return,
but I live. The duel is not lost."</p>

<p>"It is lost, Man, and to me. Have you not taken
my gift that you might spy meanly on the secret of
your beloved? Have you not opened your mind to
the evil thoughts that creep upon the citadel of
strength within and tear down its power? Of your
own deed, you are mine. My breath drinks your
breath. Your life falls down as a lamp that is
thrown from its pedestal. Your spirit rises from
its seat and looks toward those spaces where it shall
take flight tonight. Man, you die."</p>

<p>Again the surge and shock of that frigid sea
rushed upon me. I felt the swirl and hiss of the
broken wave higher about me before it sank away
down whatever dreadful strand it owned. My life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
ebbed with it, draining low. My enemy spoke the
truth. One more such wave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>My imagination sprang ahead of the event. In
fancy, I saw bright dawn filling this room of mine,
shining on the figure of a man who had been myself.
His head rested on his folded arms so that his face
was hidden. On the table beside him a vase was
overturned; a spray of heliotrope lay near and water
had trickled over scattered sheets of music, staining
the paper. By and by Vere would come to summon
that unanswering figure to the gay little breakfast-table.
Phillida would leave her place behind the
burnished copper percolator she prized so highly and
come running up the stairs. In her gentleness she
would grieve, no doubt. I was sorry for that. But
it was a contentment and pleasure for me to recall
that I had settled my financial affairs so that my little
cousin would never lack money or know any care that
I could spare her. Strange, how she had been rated
below more beautiful or more clever women until the
waif Ethan Vere had set her dearness in full sun for
us to wonder at!</p>

<p>"Pygmy, will you think of another pygmy
now?" raged the Thing. "Yourself! Think of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
yourself! Crouch! Think of death, corruption, the
vileness of the grave. Think how you are of the
grave. Think how you are alone with me. Think
how you are abandoned to me."</p>

<p>But with that tenderness for Phillida a warmth
had flowed through me like strength.</p>

<p>"Not so," my defiance answered It. "For where
I am, I stand by my own will. With where I shall
stand, you have nothing to do. Back, then, for with
the death of my body your power ends. Back&mdash;or
else face me, Thing of Darkness, while we stand in
one place."</p>

<p>At this mad challenge of mine silence closed down
like a shutting trap. Consciousness sank away from
me with a sense of swooning quietness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I stood before the Barrier on the ghostly frontier;
erect, arms folded, fronting the Breach in that inconceivably
mighty wall. Above, away out of vision
on either hand stretched the gray glimmering cliffs.</p>

<p>This I had seen before. But behind me lay that
which I had not seen. The mists I believed to be
eternal had lifted. Naked, a vast gray sea stretched
parallel with the Barrier; like it, without end or even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
a horizon to bound its enormous desolation. Between
these two immensities on the narrow strand at the
foot of the wall, I stood, pygmy indeed. In the
Breach, as of old, the Thing whose home was there
reared Itself against me.</p>

<p>"Man," It spat, "would you see me? Would
you see the Eyes once seen by the witch-woman, who
fell blasted out of human ken? Creature of clay,
crumbling now in the sea of mortality, do you brave
my immemorial age?"</p>

<p>It reared up, up, a towering formlessness. It
stooped, a lowering menace.</p>

<p>"Man, whenever man has summoned Evil since
the youngest days of the world have I not answered?
Have I not brought my presence to the magician's
lamp? Have I not shadowed the alchemist at his
crucible? When the woman called upon me with
ancient knowledge, did I not come. I am the guardian
of the Barrier. Whoever would pass this way
must pass me. Have you the power? Die, then,
and begone."</p>

<p>With a long heaving sound of waters in movement,
the gray sea stirred from its stillness. As if
drawn to some center out of sight, the tide began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
recede down that strange beach. Then realization
came to me that here was the ocean which, invisible,
had surged icy death upon me a while past. The
ocean now gathered for the final wave that should
overwhelm the defeated.</p>

<p>"Braggart!" my thought answered the taunt.
"If the witch-woman was yours, the girl Desire is
mine. This I know: as little as man has to do with
you, so little have you to do with the human and
the good. Living or dead, our path is not yours.
I did not summon you. I do dare look upon you, if
you have visible form."</p>

<p>Now in the hush a sound that I had faintly heard
as a continuing thing seemed to draw nearer. A
sound of light, swift footsteps hurrying, hurrying;
the steps of one in pitiful eagerness and haste. But
I heeded this slightly. My gaze was upon that which
took place within the cleft in the great wall. For
there the cold darkness was writhing and turning,
visible, yet obscure; as the rapids of a glassy, twisting
river might look by night. And as one might glimpse
beneath the smooth boil and heave of such a river
the dim shape of crocodile or water-monster, so in
that moving dark there seemed to lie Something from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
which the mind shrank, appalled. Now gigantic
tentacles rolled about a central mass, groping out in
unsatisfied greed. Now an ape-like shape seemed
to stalk there, rearing up its monstrous stature until
all that Breach was choked with it. It fell down
into vagueness, where huge coils upraised and sank
their loops. But through all change steadily fixed
upon me I felt the eyes of the Unseen.</p>

<p>I stood my ground. With what pain and draining
cost to my poor endurance there is no need to say.
Each instant I anticipated the surge of that returning
sea whose flood should smother out the human spark
upon its shore. This I had brought upon myself.
Yes, and would again to help Desire Michell! If
I had sheltered her for one hour&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>The Thing halted, stooped.</p>

<p>"Man, cast off the woman," It snarled at me.
"Fool, evil goes with her. For her you suffer.
Thrust her from your breast."</p>

<p>I looked down. Wavering against my breast,
just above my heart glimmered a spot of light. The
little hurrying steps had ceased. I thought, if the
bright head of Desire Michell were rested there
against me, how I would strive to shield her from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
sight of the Thing yonder. In the sweep of that
will to protect, I drew my coat about the spot of
hovering brightness.</p>

<p>I felt her press warm against me. I heard the
roar of the death-wave far out in that sea.
Before me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh Horror of the Frontier, what broke through
the dread Breach. What formed there, more
inhuman from Its likeness to humanity? What
Hand reached for me&mdash;for&mdash;us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</p></div>


<p>"Mr. Locke! Mr. Locke!"</p>

<p>I opened heavy eyes to meet the eyes of Ethan
Vere, who bent over me. Phillida was there, too, pale
of face. But what was That just vanishing into the
darkness beyond my window-sill? What malignant
glare seared disappointment and grim promise across
my consciousness? Had I brought with me or did
I hear now a whispered: "<i>Pygmy, again!</i>"</p>

<p>"Cousin, Cousin, are you very ill?" Phillida was
half sobbing. "Won't you drink the brandy, please?
Oh, Ethan, how cold he is to touch!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear," Vere bade, in his slow steadfast
way. "Mr. Locke, can you swallow some of this?"</p>

<p>I became aware that his arm supported me upright
in my chair while he held a glass to my lips. Mechanically
I drank some of the cordial. Vere put
down the glass and said a curious thing. He
asked me:</p>

<p>"Shall I get you out of this room?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>Why should he ask that, since the spectre was
for me alone? Or if he had not seen It, how did he
know this room was an unsafe area? My stupefied
brain puzzled over these questions while I managed
a sign of refusal. Any effort was impossible to me.
The cold of the unearthly sea still numbed my body.
My heart labored, staggering at each beat.</p>

<p>Vere's support and nearness were welcome to me.
His tact let me rest in the mute inaction necessary
to recovery, while my body, astonished that it still
lived, hesitatingly resumed the task of life. Somehow
he reassured and directed Phillida. Presently
she was busied with the coffee apparatus in the corner
of the room.</p>

<p>It was too much weariness even to turn my eyes
aside from the expanse of the table before me. The
vase was upset, I noted, as I had seemed to see it.
The spray of purple heliotrope Phillida had put there
the day before lay among the wet sheets of music.
The Book of Hermas lay open at the page I had last
turned, the rosy lamplight upon the text.</p>

<p>"<i>Behold, I saw a great Beast that he might
devour a city&mdash;whose name is Hegrin. Thou hast
escaped&mdash;because thou didst not fear for so terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
a Beast. If, therefore, ye shall have prepared yourselves,
yet may escape&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>What did they mean, the old, old words men have
rejected? What had Hermas glimpsed in his visions?
How many men are written down liars because they
traveled in strange lands indeed, and explorers, strove
to report what they had seen? Who before me had
stood at the Barrier and set foot on the Frontier
between the worlds?</p>

<p>The fog still dense outside was whitening with
daybreak. A few hours while the sun ran its course
once more for me, then night again, bringing completion
of the menace. I recognized that this delay
could not affect the end. Perhaps it would have
been easier if all had finished for me tonight, easier
if Vere and Phillida had not found me in time
to bring me back.</p>

<p>How had they found out my condition? Wonder
stirred under my lethargy. Had I called or cried
out? It did not seem that I could have done so.
Certainly I had not tried! I was not quite so poor
an adventurer as that.</p>

<p>Phillida was back with a cup of steaming black
coffee, tiptoeing in her anxiety and questioning Vere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
with her eyes. He took the cup, stooping to receive
my glance of assent to the new medicine.</p>

<p>The brandy had stimulated, but sickened me.
The coffee revived me so much that I was able to
take the second cup without Vere's help. When
I had walked up and down the room a few times,
leaning on his arm, life had taken me back, if only
for a little while.</p>

<p>The two nurses were so good in their care of
me that our first words were of my gratitude to
them. Then my curiosity found voice.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come in at this hour?"
I asked. "How did you know I was&mdash;ill?"</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine what made Ethan wake up,"
said Phillida, with a puzzled look toward her husband.
"He woke me by rushing out of the room
and letting the door slam behind him. Of course
I knew something must be wrong to make Drawls
hurry like that. Usually he does such a tremendous
lot in a day while looking positively lazy. So I came
rushing after and found him in here, trying to
waken you. I&mdash;I thought at first that you were not
living, Cousin Roger. It was horrible! You were
all white and cold&mdash;&mdash;" she shivered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Vere poured another cup of coffee. He said
nothing on the subject, merely observing that the
stimulant would hardly hurt me and some might
be good for Phil. I asked her to bring cups for
them both.</p>

<p>"I am not sure I really care about the coffee, but
I'll make some more," she nodded, dimpling. "I
love to drink from your wee porcelain cups with their
gold holders. You do have pretty things, you
bachelors from town."</p>

<p>When she was across the room, I asked quietly:</p>

<p>"What was it, Vere? What sent you to me?"</p>

<p>He answered in as subdued a tone, looking at the
tinted shade of the lamp instead of at my face.</p>

<p>"The young lady woke me, Mr. Locke. She
came to the bedside, whispering that you were
dying&mdash;would be dead if I didn't get to help you in
time. She was gone before Phillida roused up so
she doesn't know anything about it."</p>

<p>My heart, so nearly stopped forever and so
lethargic still, leaped in a strong beat. Desire, then,
had come back to save me. For all my doubt and
seemingly broken faith, she had brought her slight
power to help me in my hour of danger. For my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
sake she had broken through her mysterious seclusion
to call Vere and send him to my rescue.</p>

<p>Neither he nor I being unsophisticated, I understood
what Vere believed, and why he looked at the
lamp rather than at me. But even that matter had
to yield precedence to my first eagerness.</p>

<p>"You saw her?" I demanded. "You call her
young. You saw her face, then?"</p>

<p>"I could forget it if I had," he said dryly.
"As it happened, I didn't. She was wrapped in a
lot of floating thin stuff; gray, I guess? The room
was pretty dark, and I was jumping out of sleep. I
don't know why she seemed young unless it was
the easy, light way she moved. By the time I got
what she was saying and sat up, she was gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"She went out the door like a puff of smoke.
I just saw a gray figure in the doorway, where the
hall lamp made it brighter than in the room. When
I came into the hall there wasn't a sign of anybody
about. Nor afterward, either!"</p>

<p>I considered briefly.</p>

<p>"I suppose I know what you are thinking, Vere.
It is natural, but wrong. The lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>"Mr. Locke," he checked me, "I'm not&mdash;thinking.
I guess you're as good a judge as I am about
what goes on in this house. After the way you've
treated us from the first, I'd be pretty dull not to know
you're as choice of Phillida as I am; and she is all
that matters."</p>

<p>"Who is?" demanded Phillida, returning.
"Me? I haven't the least idea what you are talking
about, Drawls, but I think Cousin Roger matters a
great deal more than I do, just now. Perhaps now
he is able to tell us about this attack, and if he should
have a doctor. I have noticed for weeks how thin
and grave he has been growing to be. If only he
<i>would</i> drink buttermilk!"</p>

<p>I looked into the candid, affectionate face she
turned to me. From her, I looked to her husband,
whose New England steadiness had been tempered
by a sailor's service in the war and broadened by the
test of his experience in a city cabaret. A new
thought cleaved through my perplexities like an
arrow shot from a far-off place.</p>

<p>"How much do you both trust me?" I slowly
asked. "I do not mean trust my character or my
good intentions, but how much confidence have you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
in my sanity and commonsense? Would you believe
a thing because I told it to you? Or would
you say: 'This is outside usual experience. He is
deceiving us, or mad'?"</p>

<p>They regarded one another, smiling with an
exquisite intimacy of understanding.</p>

<p>"Don't you see yourself one little, little bit,
Cousin?" she wondered at me.</p>

<p>"Anything you say, goes all the way with us,"
Vere corroborated.</p>

<p>"Wait," I bade. "Drink your coffee while
I think."</p>

<p>"Please drink yours, Cousin Roger, all fresh
and hot."</p>

<p>I emptied the cup she urged upon me, then leaned
my forehead in my hands and tried to review the
situation. They obeyed like well-bred children,
settling down on a cushioned seat together and taking
their coffee as prettily as a pair of parakeets. They
seemed almost children to me, although there was
little difference in years between Vere and myself.
But then, I stood on the brink where years stopped.</p>

<p>With the next night, my triumphant enemy could
be put off no longer. That I could not doubt. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
cannot say that I was unafraid, yet fear weighed less
upon me than a heavy sense of solemnity and realization
of the few hours left during which I could affect
the affairs of life. What remained to be done?</p>

<p>On one of my visits to New York, I had called
on my lawyer and made my will. There were a few
pensioners for whom provision should continue after
my death. The aged music master under whom I
developed such abilities as I had, who was crippled
now by rheumatism and otherwise dependent on a
hard-faced son-in-law; the three small daughters of
a dead friend, an actor, whose care and education at
a famous school of classic dancing I had promised
him to finance&mdash;a few such obligations had been provided
for, and the rest was for Phillida.</p>

<p>But now, what of Desire Michell?</p>

<p>She had seemed so apart from common existence
that I never had thought of her possible needs any
more than of the needs of a bird that darted in and
out of my windows. Until tonight, when I had seen
her and she had proved herself all woman by her
appeal to Ethan Vere. It was not a spirit or a seeress
or "ye foule witch, Desire Michell" who had fled
to him for help in rescuing me. It was simply a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
terrified girl. What was to become of this girl?
Under what circumstances did she dwell? Had she
a home, or did she need one? Could I care for this
matter while I was here?</p>

<p>Day was so far advanced that a clamor of birds
came in to us along with a freshening air. The
strangely persistent fog had not lifted, but the lamps
already looked wan and faded in the new light. I
switched them out before speaking to the pair who
watched me.</p>

<p>"I have a story to tell you both," I said. "The
beginning of it Phillida has already heard.
Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;Have you told Vere about the woman
who visited this room, the first night I spent in the
house? Who cut her hair and left the braid in my
hand to escape from me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Will you go to my chiffonier, there in the
alcove, and bring a package wrapped in white silk
from the top drawer?"</p>

<p>She did as she was asked and laid the square
of folded silk before me. I put back the covering,
showing that sumptuous braid. The rich fragrance
of the gold pomander wrapped with it filled the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
like a vivifying elixir. Phillida gathered up the
braid with a cry of envious rapture.</p>

<p>"Oh! The gorgeous thing! How do some
lucky girls have hair like that? If it was unbound,
my two hands could not hold it all. What a pity
to have cut it! Look, Ethan, how it crinkles
and glitters."</p>

<p>She held it out to him, extended across her palms.
Vere refrained from touching the braid, surveying it
where it lay. Being a mere bachelor, I had no idea
of Phillida's emotions, until Vere's usual gravity
broke in a mischievous, heart-warming smile into
the brown eyes uplifted to him.</p>

<p>"Beautiful," he agreed politely.</p>

<p>No more. But as I saw the wistful envy pass
quite away from my little cousin's plain face and
leave her content, I advanced in respect for him.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it was even harder to speak
than I had anticipated. When Phillida laid the braid
back in its wrapping, I left it uncovered before me
and looked at its reassuring reality rather than at my
listeners. How, I wondered, could anyone be expected
to credit the story I had to tell? How should
I find words to embody it?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>Only at first! Whether there clung about me
some atmosphere of that land between the worlds
where I so recently had stood; or the room indeed
kept, as I fancied, the melancholy chill of the unseen
tide that had washed through it, I met no scepticism
from the two who heard my tale of wild experience.
They did not interrupt me. Phillida crept close to
her husband, putting her hand in his, but she did not
exclaim or question.</p>

<p>Silence held us all for a while after I had finished.
I had a discouraged sense of inadequacy. After all,
they had received but a meagre outline. The color
and body of the events escaped speech. How could
they feel what I had felt? How could they conceive
the charm of Desire Michell, the white magic of her
voice in the dark, the force of her personality that
could impress her image "sight unseen" beyond all
time to erase? How convey to a listener that, understanding
her so little, I yet knew her so well?</p>

<p>"I have told you all this because I need your
help," I said presently. "Will you give it to me?"</p>

<p>"Go away!" Phillida burst forth. She beat her
palms together in her earnestness. "Cousin Roger,
take your car and go away&mdash;far off! Go where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&mdash;nothing&mdash;can
reach you. You must not spend another
single night here. Ethan will go with you.
I will, too, if you want us. You must not
be left alone until you are quite safe; perhaps in
New York?"</p>

<p>"And, Desire Michell?"</p>

<p>"She is in no danger, I suppose. She is not
my cousin, anyhow. And even she told you to
go away."</p>

<p>"You believe my story, then? You do not think
me suffering from delusions?"</p>

<p>"Ethan saw the girl, too. If he had not come
here in time to save you, I believe you would have
died in that terrible stupor. Besides, I have seen for
weeks that something was changing you."</p>

<p>"What does Vere say?" I questioned, studying
the absorbed gravity of his expression. I wondered
what I myself would have said if anyone had brought
me such a story.</p>

<p>He passed his arm around Phillida and drew her
to him with a quieting, protective movement. His
regard met mine with more significance than he chose
to voice.</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied to take the thing as you tell it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Mr. Locke," he answered. "Phil is right, it seems
to me, about you not staying here. I don't think the
young lady ought to stay, either."</p>

<p>"She refuses to leave, Vere. What can I offer
her that I have not offered? How can I find her?
You have heard how I searched the countryside for
a hint of such a girl's presence. No one has ever
seen her; or else someone lies very cleverly."</p>

<p>In the pause, Phillida hesitatingly ventured
an idea:</p>

<p>"Perhaps she is not&mdash;real. If the monster is a
ghost thing, may not she be one, too? If we are to
believe in such things at all&mdash;&mdash;? She almost seems
to intend that you shall believe her the ghost of the
witch girl in that old book."</p>

<p>I shook my head with the helpless feeling of trying
to explain some abstruse knowledge to a child.
I had spoken of the colossal spaces, the solemn immensities
of the place where I had set my human foot.
I had tried to paint the desolate bleakness of that
Borderland where the unnamed Thing and I met,
each beyond his own law-decreed boundary, and
locked in combat bitter and strong. Phillida had
listened; and talked of ghosts the bugbears of grave-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>yard
superstition. Did Vere comprehend me better?
Did he visualize the struggle, weirdly akin to
legends of knight and dragon, as prize of which
waited Desire Michell; forlornly helpless as white
Andromeda chained to her black cliff? Could the
Maine countryman, the cabaret entertainer, seize the
truths glimpsed by Rosicrucians and mystics of lost
cults, when the highly bred college girl failed?</p>

<p>It seemed so. At least his dark eyes met mine
with intelligence; hers held only bewilderment
and fear.</p>

<p>"They are not ghosts," I said only.</p>

<p>"But how can you be sure?" she persisted.</p>

<p>Beneath the braid and the pomander lay the sheet
of paper on which Desire had written weeks before;
the first page of that composition now pouring gold
into my hands. This I passed to Phillida.</p>

<p>"Do ghosts write?" I queried.</p>

<p>She read the lines aloud.</p>

<p>"'We walk upon the shadows of hills, across a
level thrown, and pant like climbers.'"</p>

<p>"They do write, people say, with ouija boards
and mediums," she murmured.</p>

<p>I looked at Vere with despair of sustaining this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
argument. He stood up as if my appeal had been
spoken, drawing her with him.</p>

<p>"Now that it's a decent hour, don't you think
Cristina might give us some breakfast?" he suggested.
"I guess bacon and eggs would be sort of
restoring. If you feel up to taking my arm as far
as the porch, Mr. Locke, the fresh air might be good
medicine, too."</p>

<p>I have speculated sometimes upon how civilized
man would get through days not spaced by his recurrent
meals into three divisions. Those meals are
hyphens between his mind and his body, as it were.
What sense of humor can view too intensely a creature
who must feed himself three times a day? Are
we not pleasantly urged out of our heroics and into
the normal by breakfast, luncheon and dinner? Deny
it as we will, when we do not heed them we are out
of touch with nature.</p>

<p>We went downstairs.</p>

<p>After breakfast was over, Vere and I walked
across the orchard to a seat placed near the lake.
There I sat down, while he remained standing in his
favorite attitude: one foot on a low boulder, his
arm resting on his knee as he gazed into the shallow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
amber-tinted water. Fog still overlay the countryside,
but without bringing coolness. The damp heat
was stifling, almost tropical as the sun mounted
higher in the hidden sky.</p>

<p>I watched my companion, waiting for him to
speak. He appeared intent upon the darting movements
of a group of tiny fish, but I knew his thoughts
were afar.</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke, I didn't want to speak before Phillida,
because it would not do any good for her to
hear what I have to say," he finally began. "It is
properly the answer to what you asked upstairs,
about our believing you had not imagined that story.
Did anything slip out over the window-sill when you
were waking up?"</p>

<p>Startled, for I had not spoken of this, I met
his gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, exactly. Something, though! Like&mdash;well,
like something pouring itself along; a big,
thick mass. Something sort of smooth and glistening;
like black, oily molasses slipping over. Only
alive, somehow; drawing coils of itself out of the
dark into the dark. I can't put it very plain."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>"What did you think?"</p>

<p>"The air in the room was bad and close, hard
to breathe. I guessed maybe I was a little dizzy,
jumping out of bed the way I did and finding you
like dead, almost." He paused, and returned his
contemplation to the fish darting in the lake.</p>

<p>"That is what I thought," he concluded. "What
I felt&mdash;well, it was the kind of scare I didn't use
to know you could feel outside of bad dreams; the
kind you wake up from all shaking, with your face
and hands dripping sweat. That isn't all, either!"</p>

<p>This time the pause was so long that I thought he
did not mean to continue.</p>

<p>"My excuse for speaking of such matters before
Phillida is that I may need a woman friend for
Desire Michell," I reverted to the implied rebuke I
acknowledged his right to give. "I wanted her help,
and yours. More than ever, since you have shared
my experience so far, I want your advice."</p>

<p>"I'll be proud to give it, in a minute. First, it's
only fair to say I've felt enough wrong around here
to be able to understand a lot that once I might have
laughed at. Nothing compared to you! But&mdash;I've
been working about the lake sometimes after dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
or before daylight was strong, when a kind of horror
would come over me&mdash;well, I'd feel I had to get away
and into the house or go crazy. That morning when
you called from your window to ask where I'd been
so early, and I told you looking for turtles&mdash;that
was one time. I had gone out looking for turtles,
but that horror drove me in. When you hailed me,
I had it so bad that I could just about make out not
to run for the house like a scared cat, yelling all the
way. Turning back to the lake with you was a
poser. But I did; and the feeling was all gone as
quick as it came. We had a nice morning's shooting.
Once in a while I've felt it sort of driving me indoors
when I stepped off the porch or over to the barn
at night. That's a funny thing: the fear was always
outside, not in the house. I thought of that while
you were telling us how the Thing at the window
kept trying to get in at you. We haven't got a haunted
house, but a haunted place!"</p>

<p>"Why have you not spoken of this before?" I
asked, deeply stirred.</p>

<p>He made a gesture, too American to be called
a shrug. He said nothing, watching a large bubble
rise through the pure, brown-green water, float an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
instant on the surface, then vanish with the abrupt
completeness of a miniature explosion. I watched
also, with an always fresh interest in the pretty
phenomenon. Then I repeated my question, rather
impatiently as I considered what a relief his companionship
in experience would have afforded all
these weeks.</p>

<p>"Why not, Vere?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke, I don't like to keep saying that you
never exactly got used to me as your cousin's husband,"
he reluctantly replied. "But I can see it's
a kind of surprise to you right along that I don't
break down or break out in some fashion. Of course
I haven't known that you were meeting queer times,
too! If you hadn't been through any of this, what
would you have thought if I'd come to you with
stories of the place being haunted by something
nobody could see? You would have judged I was a
liar, trying to fix up an excuse for getting away from
the work here and shoving off. I don't want to go
away. I don't intend to go. I can't see any need
of it for Phil and me. But&mdash;and this is the advice
you spoke of! I think you ought to leave and leave
now. It's little better than suicide to stay."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>"And abandon Desire Michell?"</p>

<p>He turned his dark observant eyes toward me.</p>

<p>"If I said yes, you wouldn't do it. Phil and I
will take care of the young lady, if she will let us.
Couldn't a note be left for her, telling her to
come to us?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"She would not come. Now, less than
ever&mdash;&mdash;" I broke off, shot with sharp self-reproach
at the memory of how I had driven her from me
last night.</p>

<p>"You won't be any help to her if you're dead,"
he bluntly retorted.</p>

<p>At that I rose and walked a few paces to knock
out my post-breakfast pipe against an apple-tree. I
was not so sure that he was right, self-evident as his
statement appeared. Ideas moved confusedly in my
mind, convictions somehow impressed when that
golden-bronze spot of light so gently came to rest
above my heart when I last stood at the Barrier;
the light so like the bright imagined head of Desire.
To fly from my place now, herded like a cowardly
sheep by the Thing of the Frontier, would that not
be to thrust her away to save myself?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>No! Not myself, my life!</p>

<p>I had the answer now. I walked back to Vere
and took my seat again.</p>

<p>"Both of us, or neither," I told him. "If you
can help me make it both by any ingenuity, I shall be
mighty glad. It's a pleasant world! But we will
not talk any more of my running for New York like
a kicked pup. The question is, will you and Phillida
take care of the lady who calls herself Desire Michell,
if tomorrow morning finds her free, but alone
and friendless?"</p>

<p>"As long as we live, Mr. Locke," he answered.
"But I guess there isn't any disgrace in your going to
New York, running or not, if you take her with you.
And that is what ought to have been done long ago."</p>

<p>"Vere?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"You've got me! Just pick the lady up, carry
her out of that room, and have a show-down. Put
her in your car and take her to town."</p>

<p>"I gave her my word not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"People can't stand bowing to each other when
the ship's afire. If she is worth dying for, she
doesn't want you to die for her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>The simplicity of it! And, leaping the breach of
faith, the temptation!</p>

<p>What harm could I do Desire by this plan of
Vere's? What good might I not do her? Was it
mere slavishness of mind on my part not to overrule
her timid will? She must pardon me when she
realized my desperate case. A dying man might be
excused for some roughness of haste, surely.
Whether flight could save us I did not know. I
did know absolutely that my enemy had crossed the
Barrier last night, and I was prey merely withheld
from It by the chance respite of a few daylight hours.</p>

<p>Suppose our escape succeeded? A whole troup
of pictures flitted across the screen of my fancy.
Desire beside me in the city, my wife. Desire in
those delightful shops that make Fifth Avenue gay
as a garden of tulips, where I might buy for her
frocks and hats, shoes of conspicuous frivolity and
those long white gloves that seem to caress a woman's
arm&mdash;everything fair and fine. Restaurants I had
described for her, where she might dine in silken ease
and perhaps hear played the music she had named&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I aroused myself and looked at Vere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>"You'll do it?" he translated my expression.</p>

<p>"I will, if she gives me the opportunity."</p>

<p>"Do you judge she will?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. Since she went so far as to show
herself to you in order to send help to me when I was
in danger, I believe she will come to my room tonight
if I wait there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked at me silently. The consternation and
protest in his face were speech enough.</p>

<p>"If I wait there alone," I finished somewhat hurriedly.
"If she comes in time, we will try the plan.
Have the car ready. You and Phillida will be prepared,
of course. We will waste no time in getting
away as far as possible."</p>

<p>"And if that Thing comes before she does,
Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"Is there any other way?"</p>

<p>"I guess you haven't considered that you're inviting
me to stand by while you get yourself killed,"
he said stiffly. "I'm not an educated man. I never
heard the names you mentioned this morning of
people who used to study out things like this. I
never heard of any worlds except earth and heaven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and hell. But then I couldn't explain how an electric
car runs. I know the car does run; and I know you
nearly died last night. If you go back and stay
alone in that room, we both know what you are
going to meet."</p>

<p>I turned away from him because I sickened at the
prospect he evoked. The memory of that death-tide
was too near and rolled too coldly across the future.
If the trial had been hard when mercifully unanticipated,
what would it be to meet my enemy now that
I knew myself conquered? Would It not deliberately
forestall Desire's coming, tonight?</p>

<p>"Mightn't you help the lady more if you went
away now, and came back?" he urged.</p>

<p>The deserter's argument, time without end! Was
I to fall as low as that?</p>

<p>Phillida's voice called to Vere from the veranda,
summoning him to some need of farm or household.</p>

<p>"In a moment, Pretty," he called assent.</p>

<p>But he did not move. I guessed that he hoped
much from my silence and would not disturb me lest
my decision be hindered or changed.</p>

<p>By and by I stood up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>"Vere, in your varied experiences in peace and
war, did you ever chance to meet a coward?"</p>

<p>"Once," he answered briefly.</p>

<p>"And, did you like the sight?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then," I said, "let us not invite one another
to that display. Shall we go in to Phillida?"</p>

<p>After luncheon, I drove over to the village with
Phillida, who had some housewifely orders to give at
the shops. On second thoughts, Vere and I had
agreed to tell her nothing about the venture we
planned for tonight. We had satisfied her by the
assurance that I meant to start for New York before
the dangerous hours after midnight. Reassured, she
regained her usual spirits with the buoyancy of her
few years and healthy nerves. I gathered her secret
belief was that no "ghost" would dare face Ethan.</p>

<p>Which may have been quite true!</p>

<p>On our way home, we stopped at the shop of Mrs.
Hill to add to our supply of eggs, Phillida's hens having
unaccountably failed to supply their quota. I
went in, leaving my companion in the car.</p>

<p>No one else was in the shop. An impulse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
prompted me to put a question to the little woman
whose life had been spent in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hill, did you ever hear of anyone named
Desire Michell?" I asked.</p>

<p>She stopped counting eggs and blinked up at me.
Her sallow, wrinkled face lightened with curiosity
and an absurd primness.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Locke! I'd like to know where a
young city feller like you got that old story from?"</p>

<p>"I have not got it. I want you to tell it to me.
She was a witch?"</p>

<p>"She was a hussy," said Mrs. Hill severely. "I
was a little girl when she ran away from her father's
respectable house, fifty-odd years ago. The disgrace
killed him, being a clergyman. An' the gossip
that came back, later, an' pictures of her in
such dresses! Dear! Dear! The wicked certainly
have opportunities."</p>

<p>"Fifty years ago!" I echoed, dazed by this intrusion
of a third Desire Michell.</p>

<p>"Ah! Nearly seventy she'd be if she was alive
today; which she ain't. Why, she changed her name
to one fancier that you might have heard talk of?
She was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>The name she gave me I shall not set down. It
is enough to say it was that of a super-woman whose
beauty, genius and absolute lack of conscience set
Europe ablaze for a while. A torch of womanhood,
quenched at the highest-burning hour of her career
by a sudden and violent death.</p>

<p>"There was an older house once, on your place,"
she added pensively. "Did you know that? It stood
in the hollow where your lake is now. Two&mdash;three
hundred years old, folks say it was. One night it
burned down in a big thunderstorm. The Michells
then living had your house built over by the orchard,
then, an' had a dam built across so as to cover up the
old site with water. All the Michells lived there till
the last one went missionary abroad an' died in foreign
parts. I mean the hussy's brother. He took
up his father's work, feelin' a strong call. He was
only a young boy when his sister went off, but he felt
it dreadful. He was a hard man on the sinner.
Preached hell and damnation all his days, he did.
Lean over the pulpit, he would, his eyes flamin' fire
an' his tongue shrivellin' folks in their pews, I can
tell you!"</p>

<p>"He left children?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>"No, sir! Rev'rund never married. He felt
women a snare. Land, not much snarin' with what
farm women get to wear around here! I've kind
of thought of one of those blue foulard silks with
white spots into it since before I married Hill, but
never came any nearer than pricin' it an' bringin'
home a sample. He was death on sweet odors an'
soft raiment. Only sweet odors I ever get are the
ten-cent bottles Hill makes the pedlar throw in when
we trade. I do fancy <i>Jockey Club</i> for special times,
an' I've got a reasonable hope of salvation, too. I
notice your cousin, Mrs. Vere, has scent on her handkerchief
week days as well as when she's goin' somewhere,
so I guess you don't hold with the Rev'rund
Michell in New York?"</p>

<p>I laughed with her as I took up the bag of eggs.</p>

<p>"Did the runaway sister leave any children?"
I queried.</p>

<p>"Not a Michell alive anywhere," she asserted
positively. "Dead, all dead! The Rev'rund was
buried at his mission in some outlandish place. An'
if those heathen women dress like I've seen in the
movin' picture palace in the village, I don't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
how he makes out to rest with them flauntin' past
his grave!"</p>

<p>I went thoughtfully out to the car. Indeed, I
drove home in such abstraction that Phillida reproved
me.</p>

<p>"'The cat has stolen your tongue,'" she teased.
"Or did Mrs. Hill vamp you and make roast meat of
your heart with her eyes?"</p>

<p>"Phil, do you put scent on your handkerchief
week days as well as Sundays?" I shook off thought
to inquire.</p>

<p>"No; I keep sachet in my handkerchief box.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Next time you are in town, will you buy a blue
silk foulard dress with white spots in it and the
largest bottle of Jockey Club Extract on sale, and
give them to Mrs. Hill for a Christmas present? I'll
give you a blank check."</p>

<p>"Cousin Roger? Why?"</p>

<p>So I told her why. But I did not tell her the
story of the second Desire Michell; nor of the original
house that stood in the hollow now filled by
our lake.</p>

<p>Why had a peculiar horror crept through me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
when Mrs. Hill told me what ruins that water
covered? Why had I remembered the inexplicable,
repugnant sound that on several occasions had preceded
the coming of the Monster; a sound like the
smack of huge lips, or some body withdrawn from
thick slime? Was entrance into human air open to
the alien Thing only through the ruins of the house
where It had first been called by the sorceress of
long ago?</p>

<p>We were walking across from the garage, after
putting away the car, when a recollection flashed
upon me. The Metropolitan Museum, in New York,
held a portrait by a famous French artist of that
incendiary beauty whose name it now appeared
cloaked the identity of Desire Michell, daughter and
sister of New England clergymen. I had seen the
portrait. And piled in an intricate magnificence of
curls, puffs and coils about the haughty little head of
the lady, was her gold-bronze hair; the color of the
braid upstairs in my chiffonier drawer.</p>

<p>I went up to my room and opened the work of
Master Abimelech Fetherstone. Yes, there was likeness
between the poor, coarse woodcut and the
French portrait. The long, dark eyes with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
expression of blended drowsiness and watchfulness
were too individual to have escaped either record.
Moreover, both pictures resembled that face of ivory
and dusk I had glimpsed in the ray of the electric
torch, all clouded and surrounded by swirls of gray
vapor shot with gold.</p>

<p>Who and what was the girl Desire Michell whom
I had come to love through a more profound darkness
than that of the sight?</p>

<p>It seemed wisest to keep busy for the rest of the
afternoon. I sorted my music. There was the
score of a musical comedy so nearly completed that
it could be sent to those who waited for it. Vere
would attend to that, if tonight made it necessary.
I reflected with disappointment that the first rehearsals
would begin in a couple of weeks, and I had
looked forward to this production with especial interest.
There was the symphony, still unfinished, that I
had hoped might be more enduring than popular
music. If I was to be less enduring than either, we
must go glimmering on our ways. If I snatched
Desire out of her path into mine, she and I would
see all those things together.</p>

<p>I finished at last, and set my room in order. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
was a fire laid ready for lighting in my hearth, a
mere artistic flourish in such weather. I kindled it,
and put in the flames three of the volumes from the
ancient bookcase. The others were oddities in occult
science. Those three were vile and poisonous. No
doubt other copies exist, but at least I refused to be
guilty of leaving these to wreak their mischief in
Phillida's household. They burned quietly enough,
and meekly fell to ashes under my poker.</p>

<p>Our round dinner-table was cheerful as usual,
with yellow-shaded candles flanking a bowl of yellow
and scarlet nasturtiums. But I found its mistress
suffering from a nervous headache.</p>

<p>"It is only the fog," she answered our sympathy.
"It came on with the evening, somehow.
Never mind me. Cristina has made a cream-of-lettuce
bisque, and she will never forgive us if we do
not eat every bit. Yes, Ethan; of course I'll take
mine. I only wish every bush and tree would not
drip, drip like a horrid kind of clock ticking; and
the foghorns over at the lighthouses <i>moo</i> regularly
every half minute. And I never heard the waterfall
over the dam so loud!"</p>

<p>"We've had a wet summer," Vere observed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
soothingly tranquil as ever. "The lake and creek
are full. There is more water going over to make
a noise."</p>

<p>"Please do not be so frightfully sensible, Drawls.
You know I mean a different loudness. It sort of
rises up and swims all over one, then dies away."</p>

<p>"Even a fountain will seem to do that if a
wind shifts the spray," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, Cousin Roger. But there is no wind
tonight."</p>

<p>A discomfort stirred me at the simple reminder.
I fancied Vere was similarly affected. If something
moved under the water&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>We changed the conversation to a pergola planned
for building next spring, that was to be overrun by
grapevines and honeysuckle.</p>

<p>"The grapes shall hang through like an Italian
picture," Phillida anticipated, headache forgotten in
her enthusiasm. She shook her hair about her pink
cheeks, leaning over to outline a pergola with four
spoons. "Here in the middle we must have a birdbath.
Or no! The birds might peck the grapes.
We could have one of those big silver-colored looking-balls
on a pedestal to reflect wee views of the garden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and lake and sky, with people moving no bigger than
dolls. Imagine a reflection of Ethan like a Lilliputian
<i>so</i> high!"</p>

<p>So I was able to leave her eagerly hunting catalogues
of garden ornaments in her sewing-room,
when the time came for me to keep my rendezvous
with Death or the lady. In spite of my warning gesture,
Vere followed me into the hall. His dark face
was distressed and anxious.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you," he urged.</p>

<p>"No, thanks. Stay with Phil, and keep her too
busy to suspect where I am."</p>

<p>"If I'm doing wrong to let you go," he began.</p>

<p>"You cannot stop me. It is still too early for
danger, I think. If you like, you can stroll out on
the lawn from time to time and look up at my windows.
As long as the lamps are lighted in the room,
I am all right. Nothing is happening."</p>

<p>"Your lamps were all three lighted when I found
you last night," he said.</p>

<p>The darkness had been only for my eyes, then?
Certainly I had seemed to see light withdrawn from
the lamps. I mastered a tremor of the nerves, and
covered it by stroking Bagheera, who sat on a hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
chair making an after-dinner toilet with tongue
and paw.</p>

<p>"Well, take care of Phil," I repeated, evading
argument.</p>

<p>He detained me.</p>

<p>"The young lady might not come if there were
two people, Mr. Locke. I can see that! But I'll
go instead. I guess I'd be safer than you, with the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;You
know what I mean! It would be the
first time for me. And if I sat waiting in the dark,
the lady couldn't tell you were not there. Of course
I'd bring her right to you."</p>

<p>No one could appreciate the courage of that offer
so well as we who had both felt the intolerable horror
of the nearness of the Thing whose nature was beyond
our nature to endure.</p>

<p>"She would come to no one except me," I refused.
"But, thank you. And Vere, if what you
have said about my feeling toward Phillida's husband
was true once, it is true no longer."</p>

<p>His clasp was still warm on my hand when I
went into my room and switched on the lights. Soft
and colorful, the haunted room sprang into view.
The writing-table and piano gleamed bare without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
their usual burdens of scattered papers and music,
removed that afternoon. For lack of familiar occupation,
when I sat down in my favorite place, I
took up the gold pomander and fell to studying the
intricate designs worked in the metal.</p>

<p>"<i>Containing a rare herb of Jerusalem called
Lady's Rose, resembling spikenard, with vervain,
and cedar, and secret simples&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Vervain, which is powerful against evil
spirits&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>The strange fragrance, heady as the bouquet
of rich wine, never cloying, exquisite, might well
have seemed magical to the dry Puritans, I mused.
It should stay by me tonight, like a promise of
her coming.</p>

<p>After I had sat there a while, I turned out
the lights.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An excellent way to get a fayrie&mdash;and when you have her,

<p>In the darkness Time crept along like a crippled
thing, slow-moving, hideous. Outside fell the
monotonous drip, drip from trees and bushes, likened
by Phillida to a horrid clock. The fog was a sounding-board
for furtive noises that grew up like fungi
in the moist atmosphere. The thought of Phillida
and Vere down in the pleasant living room tempted
me almost beyond resistance. I wanted to spring
up, to rush out of the room; to fling myself into my
car and drive full speed until strength failed and
gasoline gave out.</p>

<p>Was that the lake which stirred in the windless
night? The lake, under which lay the fire-blackened
ruins of the house where the first Desire Michell
flung open an awful door that her vengeance might
stride through!</p>

<p>Was it too late for my Desire to come, and time
for the coming of that Other?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>The step of Vere sounded on the gravel path
where he walked beneath the window. He was
making a trip of inspection, and would find no light
shining from the room. I was about to rise and
call down a word of reassurance to him, when a
current of spiced air passed by me. I sat arrested
in hope and expectancy.</p>

<p>"Here, after my warning, after last night?"
her soft voice panted across the dark. "Will you
die, then? Cruel to me, and wicked to come here
again! Oh, must I wish you were a coward!"</p>

<p>Every vestige of her calmness gone, she was sobbing
as she spoke. I could imagine she was wringing
the little hands that once had left a betraying print
upon my table's surface.</p>

<p>"I was cruel to you last night, Desire; yet afterward
you saved my life by sending Ethan Vere to
wake me. Would you have had me leave without
meeting you again, neither thanking you nor asking
your forgiveness?"</p>

<p>I thought she came nearer.</p>

<p>"For so little, you would brave the Dread One
in Its time of triumph? O steadfast soldier, who
faces the Breach even in the hour of death, in all
that you have done you have remembered me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Why speak of anger or forgiveness? Have I not
injured you?"</p>

<p>"Never. I love you."</p>

<p>"Is not that an injury? Even though I hid
my ill-omened face from you, reared as I was to sad
knowledge of the wrath upon me, the wrong has
been done. Weak as water in the test, I kept the
letter of my promise and broke the intent. Yet go;
keep life at least."</p>

<p>"Desire, I do not understand you," I answered.
"No matter for that, now! I am content to share
whatever you bring. Not roughly or in challenge
as I asked you last night, but earnestly and with
humility I ask you to come away with me now. If
trouble comes to my wife and me, I do not doubt
we can bear it. Let us not be frightened from the
attempt. Come."</p>

<p>"I, to take happiness like that?" she marveled
in desolate amazement. "No. At least I will go
to my own place, if tardily. Roger, be kind to me.
Give me a last gift. Let me know that somewhere
you are living. Out of my sight, out of my knowledge,
but living in the same world with me. Each
moment you stay here is a risk."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>In that warning she had reason. I rose. It was
time to act, but action must be certain. If my groping
movements missed her in the dark there might
be no second chance.</p>

<p>"Desire, if all is as you say and we are not to
meet again as we have done, you shall let me touch
you before I go," I said firmly.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why, would you have me live all the
years to come in doubt whether you were a woman or
a dream? Perhaps you might seem at last a phantom
of my own sick brain to which faithfulness
would be folly? Here across the table I stretch
my arm. Lay your palm in my palm. I may
die tonight."</p>

<p>Whether she wished it also, or whether my resolve
drew obedience, I do not know. But a vague
figure moved through the dark toward me. A hand
settled in mine with the brushing touch of an alighting
bird. I closed my hand hotly upon that one. I
sprang a step aside from the table between us, found
her, and drew her to me.</p>

<p>What did I hold in my arms? Softness, fragrance,
draperies beneath which beat life and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
warmth. As I stooped to reassure her, her breath
curled against my cheek. So with that guide I turned
my head, and set my lips on the lips I had never seen.</p>

<p>Did Something uprear Itself out there in the
black fog? A cold air rushed across the summer heat
of the fog; air foul as if issued from the opened
door of a vault. As once before, a tremor quivered
through the house. The hanging chains of the
lamps swung with a faint tinkling sound.</p>

<p>I snatched Desire Michell off her feet and sprang
for the door. Somehow I found and opened it at
the first essay. We were out into the hall. With
one hand I dragged the door shut behind us, then
carried her on to the head of the stairs. There I
set her down, but stood before her as a bar against
any attempt at escape.</p>

<p>A lamp shed a subdued light above us. I looked
at my captive. Never again after that kiss could
she deny her womanhood or pose as a phantom.
So far my victory was complete. The lady might
be angry, but it must be woman's anger. I knew
she had not suspected my intention until I lifted
her in my arms. She had struggled then, after her
defenses had fallen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>She was quiet now, as though the light had
quelled her resistance. She stood drooped and
trembling; not the old-time witch, not the dazzling
adventuress, only a small fragile girl wound and
wrapped in some gray stuff that even covered the
brightness of her hair. Her face was held down
and showed no more color than a water-lily.</p>

<p>"I thought," she whispered, just audibly. "I
thought you&mdash;would say, good-bye!"</p>

<p>"I know," I stammered. "But I could not.
That way was impossible for us."</p>

<p>She did not contradict me. She was so very
small, I saw, that her head would reach no higher
than where the bright spot had rested above my heart
when I had last stood at the Barrier. One hand
gripped the veils beneath her chin, and seemed the
clenched fist of a child.</p>

<p>The crash of my door had startled the household.
I had heard Phillida cry out, and Vere's running
steps upon the gravel path. Now he came springing
up the stairs. At the head of the flight he stopped,
staring at us.</p>

<p>"Desire," I spoke as naturally as I could manage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
"this is Mr. Vere. Vere, my fianc&eacute;e, Miss Michell.
Shall we go down to Phillida?"</p>

<p>And Desire Michell did not deny my claim.</p>

<p>I am not very sure of how we found ourselves
downstairs. Nor do I remember in what words
we made the two girls known to one another. Presently
we were all in the living room, and Phillida had
possession of Desire Michell while Vere and I looked
on stupidly at the proceedings.</p>

<p>Phil had placed her in a chair beside a tall floor-lamp
and gently drew off the draperies that hooded
her. With little murmurs of compassion, she unbound
and shook free her guest's hair.</p>

<p>"My dear, you are all damp! This awful fog!
You must have been out a long time? You shall
drink some tea before we start. Drawls, will you
light the alcohol lamp on the tea-table? The kettle
is filled."</p>

<p>Now I could understand how Desire had
appeared amid a drift of fireshot smoke in the beam
of my electric torch, the night before. Her hair
was a garment of flame-bright silk flowing around
her, curling and eddying in rich abundance. Over
this she had worn the gray veils to smother all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
color and sheen into neutral sameness with night and
shadows. No wonder her face had seemed wraith-like
when her startled shrinking away from the light
had set all that drapery billowing about her.</p>

<p>She was the voice that had been my intimate
comrade through weeks of strange adventure. She
was the woman of the faded, yellow book, and the
painted beauty at the Metropolitan. She was all
the Desires of whom I had ever dreamed; and she
was none of them, for she was herself. Her long
dark eyes, suddenly lifted to me, were individual by
that ancestral blending of drowsiness with watchfulness;
yet were akin to the eyes of youth in all
times by their innocence. Her mouth, too, was the
soft mouth of a young girl kept apart from sordid
life. But her forehead, the noble breadth between
the black tracery of her eyebrows, expressed the student
whose weird, lofty knowledge had so often
abashed my ignorance.</p>

<p>Only my ignorance? Now as she looked at me
across the room, all self-confidence trickled away
from me. What distinguished me from a thousand
men she might meet on any city street? What had
I ever said worth note in the hours we had spent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
together? Now she saw me in the light, plainly
commonplace; and remembering myself lame, I stood
amazed at the audacity with which I had laid
claim to her.</p>

<p>She was rising from the chair, gently putting
aside Phillida's detaining hands. She had not spoken
one word since her faltered speech to me, upstairs.
Neither Vere nor Phillida had heard her voice. She
had given her hand to each of them and submitted
to Phil's care with a docility I failed to recognize in
my companion of the dark. Her decisive movement
now was more like the Desire Michell I knew. Only,
what was she about to do? Repudiate my violence
and me&mdash;perhaps go back to her hiding-place?</p>

<p>She came straight to where I stood, not daring
even to advance toward her. We might have been
alone in the room. I rather think we were, to
her preoccupation.</p>

<p>"You must go away," she said. "If there is any
hope, it is in that. Nothing else matters, now; nothing!
If you wish, take me with you. It would be
wiser to leave me. But nothing really matters except
that you should not stay here. I will obey you in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
everything if you will only go. Take your car and
drive&mdash;drive fast&mdash;anywhere!"</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey the desperate urgency
and fervor of her low voice. Phillida uttered an
exclamation of fear. Vere wheeled about and left
the room. The front door closed behind him. The
gravel crunched under his tread on the path to the
garage, and the rate at which the light he carried
moved through the fog showed that he was running.
He obviously accepted the warning exactly as it was
given. After the briefest indecision, Phillida hurried
out into the hall.</p>

<p>For my part, I did nothing worth recording. I
had made discovery of two places where I was not
the "lame feller." And if the first place was the
dreary Frontier, the second country was that rich
Land of Promise in Desire Michell's eyes.</p>

<p>What we said in our brief moment of solitude
is not part of this account.</p>

<p>Phillida was back promptly, her arms full of
garments. With little murmurs of explanation by
way of accompaniment, she proceeded to invest
Desire in a motor coat and a dark-blue velvet hat
rather like an artist's tam-o'shanter. I noticed then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
that the girl wore a plain frock of gray stuff, long
of sleeve and skirt, fastened at the base of her throat
with severe intent to cover from sight all loveliness
of tint and contour. Nothing farther from the
fashion of the day or the figure of my cousin could
be imagined.</p>

<p>"You must wear the coat because it is always
cool motoring at night," Phillida was murmuring.
"And of course you will want it at a hotel; until
you can do some shopping. I will just tie back your
gorgeous, scrumptious hair with this ribbon, now. I
know I haven't enough hairpins to put it up without
wasting an awful lot of time, but we will buy them in
the morning. We are going to take the very best care
of you every minute, so you must not worry."</p>

<p>"You are so kind to me," Desire began tremulously.
"No one was ever so kind! It does not
matter about me, or what people think of me, if he
will only go from here quickly."</p>

<p>"Right away," Phillida soothed. "My husband
has gone for the car. I hear him coming now!"</p>

<p>In fact, Vere was coming up the veranda steps.
His hand was on the knob of the outer door, fum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>bling
with it in a manner not usual to him, then the
knob yielded and he was inside.</p>

<p>"But how slow you are, Drawls," his wife called,
with an accent of wonder.</p>

<p>Vere crossed the threshold of the room, his gaze
seeking mine. He was pale, and drops of fog moisture
pearled his dark face like sweat.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr. Locke," he addressed me,
ignoring the others. "Perhaps you felt that
shake-up, a quarter-hour ago? Like a kind of earthquake,
or the kick from a big explosion a long ways
off? It didn't seem very strong to me. It was too
strong for that old tree by the garage, though! Must
have been decayed clear through inside. Willows
are like that, tricky when they get old."</p>

<p>"Ethan, what <i>are</i> you talking about?" cried
Phillida, aghast.</p>

<p>He continued to look at me.</p>

<p>"I guess it must have fallen just about when you
slammed your door upstairs. Seems I do remember
a sort of second crash following the noise you made.
I was too keen on finding out what was happening
up there to pay much heed."</p>

<p>"Well, Vere?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>"Tree smashed down through the roof of the
garage," he reluctantly gave his report. "Everything
under the hood of the automobile is wrecked.
There is no motor left, and no radiator. Just junk,
mixed up with broken wood and leaves and pieces of
the stucco and tiles of the garage."</p>

<p>So there was to be no going tonight from the
house beside the lake. A frustrated group, we stood
amid our preparations; the two girls wearing cloaks
and hats for the drive that would never be taken.
Had we ever really expected to go? Already the
project was fading into the realm of fantastic ideas,
futile as the pretended journeys of children who
are kept in their nursery. Desire lifted her hands
and took off the blue velvet cap with a resignation
more expressive than words. Only my practical
little cousin charged valiantly at all obstacles.</p>

<p>"We aren't ever going to give up?" she cried
protest. "Cousin Roger? Ethan? <i>You</i> cannot
mean to give up. Why&mdash;'phone to the nearest
garage to send us another car. If we pay them
enough they will drive anywhere. Or if they cannot
take us to New York, they will take us to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
railroad station where we can get a train for some
place. Can't we, Drawls?"</p>

<p>"We could," Vere admitted. "I'd admire to
try it, anyhow. But the telephone wire came across
the place right past the garage, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tree tore the wire down, too?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it snapped right in two, Phil."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we might walk," she essayed.</p>

<p>But even her brave voice trailed into silence as
she glanced toward the black, dripping night beyond
the windows.</p>

<p>"Or if we found a horse and wagon," she murmured
a final suggestion.</p>

<p>Vere shook his head.</p>

<p>"Come!" I assumed charge with a cheerfulness
not quite sincere. "None of us are ready for such
desperate efforts to leave our cozy quarters here.
Especially as I fancy Vere's 'earthquake' was the
tremor of an approaching thunderstorm. I felt it,
myself. Let us light all the lamps and draw the
curtains to shut out the fog which has got on everyone's
nerves by its long continuance. We are overwrought
beyond reason. Suppose we sit here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
together, strong in numbers, for the few hours until
daylight? I think that should be safeguard enough.
Tomorrow we will do all we had planned for tonight.
Come in, Vere, and close the door."</p>

<p>He obeyed me at once. Desire Michell passively
suffered me to unfasten and take off the coat she
wore, too heavy for such a night. She had uttered
no word since Vere announced the destruction of the
car. She did not speak now, when I put her in the
low chair beneath the lamp. I had a greed of light
for her, as a protection and because darkness had
held her so long.</p>

<p>"It seems as if we should do something!"
Phillida yielded unwillingly.</p>

<p>Vere's eyes met mine as he turned from drawing
the last curtain. We were both thinking of
the force that had driven the frail old willow tree
through tile and cement of the new building to flatten
the metal of motor and car into uselessness. The
mere weight of the tree would not have carried it
through the roof. To "do something" by way of
physical escape from that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The ribbon had glided from Desire's hair, almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
as if the vital, resilient mass resentfully freed itself
from restraint by the bit of satin. Now she put up
her hands with a slow movement and drew two broad
strands of the glittering tresses across her shoulders,
veiling her face.</p>

<p>"Wait," she answered Phillida, most unexpectedly.
"I must be sure&mdash;quite sure! I must think.
If you will&mdash;wait."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Oh, little booke&mdash;how darst thou put thyself in press for
drede?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chaucer.</span></p></div>


<p>We sat quietly waiting. I had drawn a chair near
Desire. Phillida and Vere were together, chairs
touching, her right hand curled into his left. Bagheera
the cat had slipped into the room before the
door was closed, and lay pressed against his mistress's
stout little boot. Our small garrison was assembled,
surely for as strange a defense as ever sober moderns
undertook. For my part, it was wonder enough to
study that captive who was at once so strange yet so
intimately well known to me.</p>

<p>The Tiffany clock on the mantel shelf chimed
midnight. Soon after, we began to experience the
first break in the heavy monotony of heat and fog
that had overlaid the place for three days. The
temperature began to fall. The fog did not lift.
The flowered cretonne curtains hung straight from
their rods unstirred by any movement of air. But
the atmosphere in the room steadily grew colder. I
saw Phillida shiver in the chill dampness and pull<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
closer the collar of her thin blouse. When Desire
finally spoke, we three started as if her low tones had
been the clang of a hammer.</p>

<p>"I have tried to judge what is best," she said,
not raising her face from its shadowing veil of hair.
"I am not very wise. But it seems better that there
should be no ignorance between us. If I had been
either wise or good, I should never have come down
from the convent to draw another into danger and
horror without purpose or hope of any good ending."</p>

<p>"The convent?" I echoed, memory turning to
the bleak building far up the hillside. "You came
from there?"</p>

<p>"There is a path through the woods. I am very
strong and vigorous. But I had to wait until all
there were asleep before I could come. Sometimes I
could not come at all. For this house, I had my
father's old key. It was only for this little time
while I am being taught. Soon I will put on a nun's
dress and cut my hair, and&mdash;and never&mdash;never leave
there any more."</p>

<p>Stupefied, I thought of the black loneliness of the
wooded hillside behind us. No wonder the fog was
wet upon her hair! Her slight feet had traversed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
path night after night, had brought her to the door
her key fitted, had come through the dark house to
the door of the room upstairs. When she left me, she
had toiled that desolate way back. For what? Humility
bent me, and bewilderment.</p>

<p>"But why?" Phillida gasped. "Why? Cousin
Roger hunted everywhere to find you. He would
have gone anywhere you told him to see you. Didn't
you know that?"</p>

<p>"I never meant him to see me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I am Desire Michell, fourth of that name; all
women who brought misfortune upon those who
cared for them," she answered, her voice lower still.
"How shall I make you understand? I was brought
up to know the wrath and doom upon me, yet I myself
can scarcely understand. My father knew all, yet he
fell in weakness."</p>

<p>"Your father?" I questioned, recalling Mrs.
Hill's positive genealogy of the Michells in which
there was no place for this daughter of the line.</p>

<p>"He was the last of his family. When he was
very young the conviction came to him that his duty
was never to marry, so our race might cease to exist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
He lived here and preached against evil. He studied
the ancient learning that he might be fitted to wrestle
with sin. But in the end horror of what was here
gained upon him so that he closed the house and
went abroad to work as a missionary. There was a
girl; the daughter of the clergyman who was leaving
the mission. My father&mdash;fell in love. He forgot all
his convictions and married her. He knew it was a
sin, but it was stronger than he was. She only lived
one year. When I was born, she died. He prayed
that I would die, too. But&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice died into silence. I ventured to lean
nearer and take her hand into mine.</p>

<p>"Desire," I said, "why should you be a sufferer
for the actions of a woman who died over two centuries
ago? What is the long dead Desire Michell
to you?"</p>

<p>A strange and solemn hush followed my question.
The words seemed to take a significance and importance
beyond their simple meaning. The hand I
held trembled in my clasp. She answered at last,
just audibly:</p>

<p>"You know. You said that you had read
her book."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>"But the book tells so little, Desire. Just such
a chronicle of superstition as may be found in a
hundred old records."</p>

<p>She shook her head slightly.</p>

<p>"Not that! Bring me the book."</p>

<p>The book was upstairs in the room from which I
had carried her half an hour before in something
very like a panic flight. Before I could release her
hand and rise, before I comprehended his intention,
Vere was out of the living room and upon the stairs.
It was too late to overtake him. The man who had
been a professional skater covered the stairs in a few
easy, swinging strides. We heard his light tread on
the floor overhead, heard him stop beside the table
where the book lay. Then, he was returning. My door
closed. His step sounded on the stairs again; in a
moment he was back among us, and quietly offering
the volume to our guest. His dark eyes met mine
reassuringly, deprecating the thoughts I am sure my
face expressed.</p>

<p>"Lights burning and all serene up there," he
announced.</p>

<p>Desire touched the book with a curious repugnance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>"I was looking for this, the first night I came
here," she murmured. "That is why I came to
America after my father died. I had promised him
to destroy this record. When I heard that the house
was sold to a gentleman from New York, I came
down from the convent on the hill to find the bookcase
holding the old history. I did not know anyone
was here, that night, until you touched my hair."</p>

<p>I remembered the bookcase near the bed, where I
stood my candle and matches. Unaware, I had prevented
her finding the thing she sought, and so forced
her to return. Afterward, the house had been full
of workmen making alterations and improvements,
until later still Phillida had transferred the bookcase
and its contents to her sewing room. If I had not
taken the whim to sleep in the old house on the night
of my purchase, or if I had chosen another room, the
existence of Desire Michell might never have been
known to me.</p>

<p>Would the creature from the Barrier have appeared
to me, if I had not known her?</p>

<p>She was drawing something from behind the
portrait of the first Desire Michell; a thin, small
book that had lain concealed between the cover of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
larger volume and the page bearing the woodcut,
where a sort of pocket was formed that had escaped
our notice. Laid upon the table, the little book
rolled away from the girl's fingers and lay curled
upon itself in the lamplight. The limp morocco cover
was spotted with mildew and half-revealed pages of
close, fine writing blotched in places with rusty stains.
It gave out an odor of mould and age in an atmosphere
made sweet by Desire's presence.</p>

<p>Phillida, who had been silent even when Vere left
her to go upstairs, shrank away from the book on the
table. She darted a glance over her shoulder at
the curtained windows behind her.</p>

<p>"Drawls, I cannot help what everybody thinks of
me," she said plaintively. "I am cold. The fire is
ready laid in the grate. Will you put a match to
it, please?"</p>

<p>No one smiled at the request. Her husband
uttered some soothing phrase of compliance. We all
looked on while the flame caught and began to creep
up among the apple-logs. Bagheera rose and changed
his position to one before the hearth. When Vere
stood erect, Desire leaned toward him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>"Will you read, aloud, sir?" she asked of him,
and made a gesture toward the morocco book.</p>

<p>She surprised us all by that choice. I was unreasoning
enough to feel slighted, although the task
was one for which I felt a strong dislike. I fancied
Vere liked the idea no better, from his expression.
However, he offered no demur, but sat down at the
table and began to flatten the warped pages that
perversely sprang back and clung about his fingers.
Desire slowly turned her lovely eyes to me, eyes that
looked by gift of nature as if their long corners had
been brushed with kohl. She said nothing, yet somehow
conveyed her meaning and intent. I understood
that she did not wish to hear me read those pages;
that it was painful to her that they should be read
at all.</p>

<p>Vere was ready. He glanced around our circle,
then began with the simple directness that gave him a
dignity peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>"'Mistress Desire Michell, her booke, Beginning
at the nineteenth year of her Age,'" he read, in
his leisurely voice.</p>

<p>The living Desire Michell and I were regarding
one another. I smiled at the quaint wording, but she
shuddered, and put her hands across her eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>Yet there was nothing in those first pages except
a girl's chronicle of village life. This book evidently
carried on a diary kept from early childhood; a diary
written out of loneliness. Apparently the bare colonial
life pressed heavily upon the writer; who, having
no companions of the intellect, turned to this record
of her own mind as a prisoner might talk to his reflection
in a mirror rather than go mad from sheer
silence. Discontent and restlessness beat through the
lines like fluttering wings. She wrote of her own
beauty with a cool appraisal oddly removed from
vanity, almost with resentment of a possession she
could not use.</p>

<p>"Like a man who finds treasure in a desert isle,
I am rich in coin that I may not spend," she wrote.
"I stand before my mirror and take a tress of my
hair in either hand; I spread wide my arms full
reach, yet I cannot touch the end of those tresses.
Nor can my two hands clasp the bulk of them. There
have been other women who had such hair, who were
of body straight and white, and had the eyes&mdash;but I
cannot read that they stayed poor and obscure."</p>

<p>There followed some quotations from the classics
of which I was able to give but vague translations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
when Vere passed the book to me, both because my
knowledge was scanty and because of their daring
unconventionality. There were allusions, too, to
ladies of later history who had found fairness a
broad staircase for ambition to mount. Of the
writer's learning, there could be no question; a learning
amazing in one so young and so situated. The
source of this became apparent. Her father was
consumed with the passion of scholarship, and the
girl's hungry mind fed in the pastures where he
led the way.</p>

<p>Here crept into view an anomaly of character.
The austere Puritan divine, whose life was open and
blank, bare and cold as a winter field, cherished a
secret dissipation of the mind. He labored upon a
book on the errors of magic. So laboring, he became
snared by the thing he denounced. He believed
in the hidden lore while he condemned it.
Deeper and deeper into forbidden knowledge his
eagerness for research led him. Unsanctioned by
any church were the books Dr. Michell starved his
body to buy from Jews or other furtive dealers in
unusual wares. The titles in his library comprehended
the names of more charlatans than bishops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
He could define the distinctions between necromancy,
sorcery, and magic. The marvelous calculations of
the Pythagoreans engaged him, and the lost mysteries
of the Cabiri.</p>

<p>From such studies he would arise on the Sabbath
to preach sermons that held his dull flock agape.
Bitter draughts of salvation he poured for their spiritual
drinking. He scarcely saw how any man might
escape hell-fire, all being so vile. Against witchcraft
and tampering with Satan's agents he was eloquent.
He rode sixty miles in midwinter to see a Quaker
whipped and a woman hung who had been convicted
as a witch.</p>

<p>Of all this, his daughter wrote with an elfin
mockery. Her brilliant eye of youth saw through
the inconsistency of the beliefs he strove to reconcile.
She learned his lore, read his books, and discarded
his doctrine.</p>

<p>"I study with him, but I think alone," she set
down her independence.</p>

<p>Without his knowledge, she proceeded to actual
experiment with rude crucible and alembic in her
own chamber. She essayed some age-old recipes
of blended herbs and ingredients within her reach,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
handled at certain hours of the night and phases of the
moon. All were innocent enough, it seemed. She
cured a beloved old dog of rheumatism and partial
blindness. She discovered an exquisite perfume
which she named Rose of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>But the experiments were not fortunate, she
made obscure complaint. The dog, cured, lived only
a few weeks. The perfume, in which she revelled
with a fierce, long-denied appetite, steeping her rich
hair in it and her severely dull garments, awoke many
whispers in a community where sweet odors were
unknown and disapproved. She alluded, with a
mingling of freezing scorn and triumph, to the young
men who followed after her&mdash;"seeking a wife who
would be at their hearth as fatal a guest as that fair
woman sent by an enemy to Alexander the Great,
whose honey breath was deadly poison to who so
kissed there."</p>

<p>Into this situation rode the fine gentleman from
the colonial world of fashion who was to fix the fate
of Desire Michell and his own.</p>

<p>From this point on, the diary was a record of
the same story as the "History of Ye foule Witch,
Desire Michell."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>The love affair that followed Sir Austin's visit
to the clergyman's house leaped hot and instant as
flame from oil and fire brought together. The girl
was parched with thirst for life, yet despised all
around her. The man was dazzled by a beauty and
mentality foreign as a bird of paradise found nested
in Connecticut snow. A mad, wild passion linked
them that was more than half a duel. For Sir Austin
was already betrothed. Honor might not have
chained him for long, but his need of his betrothed's
fortune proved more enduring. He was a man bred
to wealth, who did not possess it. He offered Desire
Michell his left hand.</p>

<p>He was turned out of her father's house with a
red weal struck across his face like a brand.</p>

<p>Of course he returned. The arrow was firmly
fixed. He asked her to marry him, and was refused
with savage contempt. He would not take the refusal.
Her heart and ambition were hidden traitors
to his cause. In the end she surrendered and the
marriage day was set.</p>

<p>Sir Austin rode away to set his house in order,
while Desire turned from alchemy to make her wedding
garments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>The entries during this interval were sweetly gentle
and feminine. Her Rose of Jerusalem fragrance
was all her own, and was kept so, but she made less-rare
essences and sold them through a pedlar in
order to buy fine linen and brocade for a trousseau
not designed to be worn in a Puritan village. She
was happy and at rest in expectation.</p>

<p>On her wedding day the destroying news fell.
Sir Austin hid a weak spirit within a strong and
handsome body. Away from Desire's glamour, back
in New York, he had not broken his engagement to
the heiress. Instead, he had married her on the day
arranged before he met the clergyman's daughter.</p>

<p>There was never again a connected record in the
diary. Pages were torn out in places, entries were
broken off, half-made. But the story Vere's slow,
steady voice conveyed to us was the one we knew;
the one my Desire had told to me the first night I
slept in this house. The half-mad girl turned to
her father's deadly books. Sir Austin died as his
waxen image dissolved before the fire, where the
girl sat watching with merciless hate. He died,
raving and frothing, on her door-sill. She never
saw him after the day he rode away to prepare for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
their marriage. She set open her window that she
might hear his progress to that hard death, but never
deigned to turn her glance upon him.</p>

<p>The clergyman was dead, now; of shame, or
perhaps of terror at the child he had reared. The
girl was alone.</p>

<p>The diary grew wilder, with gaps of weeks where
there were no entries. More frequently, pages were
missing and paragraphs obliterated by the reddish
blotches like rust or blood. There were accounts of
weird, half-told experiments ranging through the
three degrees of magic set forth by Talmud and
Cabala. She wrote of legions of kingdoms between
earth and heaven, and the twelve unearthly worlds of
Plato. She alluded to a Barrier between men and
other orders of beings, beyond which dwelt Those
whom the magicians of old glimpsed after long toil
and incantation.</p>

<p>"Those of whom Vertabied, the Armenian, says:
'<i>Their orders differ from one another in situation and
degree of glory, just as there are different ranks
among men, though they are all of one nature.</i>' They
cannot cross nor overthrow this Wall, nor can
man alone; but if they and man join together&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>&mdash;One
there beyond whispers to me of power, splendor,
victory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Days later, there was entered a passage of mad
triumph and terror. The Barrier was broken
through. Out of the breach issued the One whom
she had invited to her silver lamps; colossal, formless,
whose approach froze blood and spirit. Eyes of unspeakable
meaning glared across the dark, whispers
unbearable to humanity beat upon her intelligence and
named her comrade.</p>

<p>Now as Vere read this, I felt again that quiver
of the house or air he had likened to an earth shock
and held responsible for the fall of the willow tree
that had destroyed our hope of escape by automobile.
I looked at my companions and saw no evidence of
anyone having noticed what I had seemed to feel.
Vere indeed was pale; while Phillida, who sat beside
him, was highly flushed with excitement and wonder
as she listened. Desire had not stirred in her chair,
except to bend her head so her face was shaded by
the loosened richness of her hair. Seeing them so
undisturbed, I kept silence. A storm might be
approaching, but I made no pretense to myself of
believing that shock either thunder or earthquake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>The tone of the diary altered rapidly. At first,
the unknown from beyond the wall appalled the
woman only by its unhuman strangeness, the repugnance
of flesh and blood for its loathly neighborhood.
Fear emanated from its presence, seen yet
unseen, a blackness moving in the black of night when
it visited her. Yet she had courage to endure those
awful colloquies. She listened. She strove by the
spell and incantation to subdue This to her service,
as the demon Orthone served the Lord of Corasse,
as Paracelsus was served by his Familiar, or Gyges
by the spirit of his ring.</p>

<p>Alas for the sorceress, misguided by legend and
fantasy! She had evoked no phantom, but a fact
actual as nature always is even if nature is not
humanly understood. The Thing was real.</p>

<p>The awe of the magician became the stricken
panic of the woman. She had unloosed what she
could not bind. She had called a servant, and gained
a master. Gone forever were the dreams of power
and splendor and triumph. Now she learned that
only pure magic can discharge the spirits it has summoned,
nor could a murderess attain that lofty art.</p>

<p>We were given a glimpse of a frantic girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
crouched in the useless pentagram traced on the floor
for her protection, covering her beauty with the
cloak of her hair against the eyes that burned upon
her between the overturned silver lamps.</p>

<p>A deepening horror gathered about the house of
Mistress Desire Michell. The old dame who had
been the girl's nurse and caretaker fled the place and
fell into mumbling dotage in a night. No child
would come near the garden, though fruit and nuts
rotted away where they dropped from overripeness.
No neighbor crossed the doorstep where Sir Austin
had died. She lived in utter solitude by day. By
night she waged hideous battle against her Visitor;
using woman's cunning, essaying every expedient and
art her books suggested to her desperate need.</p>

<p>With each conflict, her strength and resource
waned, while That which she held at bay knew no
weariness. Time was not, for it, nor change
of purpose.</p>

<p>"I faint, I fail!" she wrote. "The Sea of
Dread breaks about my feet. It is midnight. The
pentagram fades from the floor&mdash;the nine lamps
die&mdash;the breath of the One at the casement is
upon me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Vere stopped.</p>

<p>"A handful of pages have been torn out here,"
he stated. "The next entry that I can read is in the
middle of a stained page, and must be considerably
later on."</p>

<p>Phillida made an odd little noise like a whimper,
clutching at his sleeve. The third shock for which
I had been waiting shuddered through the house,
this time distinctly enough for all to feel. A gust of
wind went through the wet trees outside like a gasp.</p>

<p>"Ethan, what was that?" she stammered.
"Oh, I'm afraid! Cousin Roger&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I had no voice to answer her. In my ears was
the rush and surge of that sea whose waters had
gripped me in the past night. I felt the icy death-tide
hiss around me in its first returning wave, rise to
my knee's height, then sink away down its unearthly
beach. What I had dimly known all day, underlying
Vere's sturdy cheerfulness and our plans and efforts,
was the truth. Through those intervening hours of
daylight I had remained my enemy's prisoner, bound
on that shore we both knew well, until It pleased or
had power to return and finish with me. No doubt
It was governed by laws, as we are.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>As before, the cold struck a paralysis across my
senses. Vere's reassurance sounded faint and distant.</p>

<p>"The thunder is getting closer," he said. "That
was a storm wind, all right! Would you rather go
upstairs and lie down, and not hear any more of this
stuff tonight?"</p>

<p>"No! Oh, no! I could not bear to be alone,"
she refused. "Just, just go on, dear. Of course it is
the coming storm that makes the room so cold."</p>

<p>He put his left arm around her as she nestled
against him. His right hand held the diary flattened
on the table under the light.</p>

<p>"The next entry is just one line in the middle
of a page where everything else is blotted out,"
Vere repeated. "It reads: 'The child is a week
old today.'"</p>

<p>The wave crashed foaming in tumult up the
strand, flowing higher, drenching me in cold sharp as
fire. The tide rose faster tonight. The silence that
held the others dumb before the significance of that
last sentence covered my silence from notice. Desire's
face was quite hidden; lamplight and firelight wavered
and gleamed across her bent head. I wanted to
arise and go to her, to take her hands and tell her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to have patience and courage. But when this wave
ebbed, my strength drained away with the receding
water. Moreover, the darkness curdled and moved
beyond the window opposite me. The curtains hung
between were no bar to my vision, as the light and
presence of my companions were no bar to the Thing
that kept rendezvous with me. Since last night, we
were nearer to one another.</p>

<p>A breath of chill foulness crept across the pungent
odor of the burning apple-log in the fireplace.
A whisper spoke to my intelligence.</p>

<p>"Man conquered by me, fall down before me.
Beg my forbearance. Beg life of me&mdash;and take
the gift!"</p>

<p>"No," my thought answered Its.</p>

<p>"You die, Man."</p>

<p>"All men die."</p>

<p>"Not as they die who are mine."</p>

<p>"I am not yours. You kill me, as a wild beast
might. But I am not yours; not dying nor dead am
I yours."</p>

<p>"Would you not live, pygmy?"</p>

<p>"Not as your pensioner."</p>

<p>The logs on the hearth crackled and sank down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
with a soft rustle, burned through to a core of glowing
red. Phillida spoke with a hushed urgency,
drawing still closer to her husband, so that her forehead
rested against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Go on, Ethan. Finish and let us be done."</p>

<p>Vere bent his head above the book on the table to
obey her. Across the dark I suddenly saw the Eyes
glare in upon him.</p>

<p>"On the next page, the writing begins again,"
he said. "It says:</p>

<p>"'I am offered the kingdoms of earth. But I
crave that kingdom of myself which I cast away.
The child is sent to England. The circle is drawn.
The names are traced and the lamps filled. Tonight
I make the last essay. There remains untried one
mighty spell. This Mystery&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>A clap of thunder right over the house
overwhelmed the reader's voice. Phillida screamed as a
violent wind volleyed through the place with a crashing
of doors and shutters, upstairs and down. The
diary was ripped from beneath Vere's hand and
hurled straight to the center of that nest of fire
formed by the settling of the logs. A long tongue of
flame leaped high in the chimney as the spread leaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
of the book caught and flared, fanned by wind and
draft. Vere sprang up, but Phillida's clinging arms
delayed him. When he reached the fire-tongs there
was nothing to rescue except a charring mass half-way
toward ashes.</p>

<p>He turned toward me, perhaps at last surprised
by my immobility.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr. Locke," he apologized.</p>

<p>Desire had started up with the others when the
sudden uproar of the storm burst upon them. Now
she cried out, breaking Vere's excuse of the loss.
Her small face blanched, she ran a few steps
toward me.</p>

<p>"It has come! He will die&mdash;he is dying.
Look, look!"</p>

<p>Desire Michell was beside me, and I could not
rise or answer her. She bent over me, so that the
Rose of Jerusalem fragrance inundated me and drove
back the sickening air that was the breath of
our enemy.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she sobbed, her head beside my
head. "If you can hear me, listen and leave me as
It wills. You know now that I belong to It by
heritage? You know why we can never be together
as you planned? Try to feel horror of me. Put
me away from you. No evil can come to me unless
I seek evil. But It will not suffer you to take me.
Live, dear Roger, and let me go."</p>

<p>"Yield to me, Man, what you may not keep," the
whisper of the Thing followed after her voice.
"Would you take the witch-child to your hearth?
Cast her off; and taste my pardon."</p>

<p>"Can you hear, Roger? Roger, let me go."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>With an effort terrible to make as death to meet,
I broke from the paralysis that chained me. As
from the drag of a whirlpool, I tore myself from the
tide-clutch, from the will of the Thing, from the
numb weakness upon me. For a moment I thrust
back the hand at my throat. I stood up and drew
Desire up with me in my arms, both of us reeling
with my unsteadiness.</p>

<p>"I do not give you up," I said, my speech hoarse
and difficult. "I claim you, now, and after. And
my claim is good, because I pay."</p>

<p>Desire exclaimed something. What, I do not
know. Her voice was lost in the triumphant conviction
that I was right. She was free, and the freedom
was my gift to her. I was not vanquished, but victor.
The life I paid was not a penalty, but a price.</p>

<p>Her face was uplifted to mine as she clung to
me; then my weight glided through her arms and I
fell back in my chair.</p>

<p>I was alone amid blackness and desolation that
poured past me like the wind above the world.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For the last time, I opened my eyes on the gray
shore at the foot of the Barrier. I, pygmy indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
stood again before the colossal wall whose palisades
reared up beyond vision and stretched away beyond
vision on either side.</p>

<p>I was alone here. No whisper of taunt or menace,
no presence of horror troubled me. Opposite me, the
Breach that split the cliff showed as a shadowed
ca&ntilde;on, empty except of dread. Far out behind me
the sea that was like no sea of earth gathered itself
beneath its eternal mists as a tidal wave draws and
gathers. With folded arms I stood there, waiting
for the returning surge of mighty waters to overwhelm
me in their flood. I waited in awe and solemn
expectancy, beyond fear or hope.</p>

<p>But now I became aware of a new doubleness of
experience. Here on the Frontier, I was between the
worlds, yet I also saw the room in the house left
behind. I saw myself as an unconscious body reclined
in a chair beside the hearth. Desire Michell
knelt on the floor beside me, her hands grasping my
arms, her gaze fixed on my face, her hair spilling its
shining lengths across my knees. Phillida was huddled
in a chair, crying hysterically. Vere apparently
had been trying to force some stimulant upon the
man who was myself, yet was not myself, for while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
I watched he reluctantly rose from bending above the
figure and set a glass upon the table. I echoed his
sigh. Life was good.</p>

<p>The sea behind me began to rush in from immeasurable
distances. The roar of the waters' thunderous
approach blended with the heat and flash of storm all
about the house into which I looked.</p>

<p>"He dies," Desire spoke, her voice level and
calm. "Has it not been so with all who loved the
daughters of my race these two centuries past? Yet
never did one of those die as he dies&mdash;not for passion,
but for protection of the woman&mdash;not as a madman
or one ignorant, but facing that which was not meant
for man to face, his eyes beating back the intolerable
Eyes. Oh, glory and grief of mine to have seen this!"</p>

<p>Phillida cowered lower in her chair, burying her
face in the cushions. But Vere abruptly stood erect,
his fine dark face lifted and set. Just so some
ancestors of his might have risen in a bleak New
England meeting-house when moved powerfully to
wrestle with evil in prayer. But it is doubtful if any
Maine deacon ever addressed his Deity as Vere
appealed to his.</p>

<p>"Almighty, we're in places we don't understand,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
he spoke simply as to a friend within the room, his
earnest, drawling speech entirely natural. "But
You know them as You do us. If things have got to
go this way, why, we'll make out the best we can.
But if they don't, and we're just blundering into
trouble, please save Roger Locke and this poor girl.
Because we know You can. Amen."</p>

<p>Now at this strange and beautiful prayer&mdash;or so
it seemed to me&mdash;a ray of blinding light cleaved up
from where Vere stood, like a shot arrow speeding
straight through house and night into inconceivable
space. Then the room vanished from my sight as the
great wave burst out of the mist upon me.</p>

<p>I went down in a smother of ghastly snarling
floods cold as space is cold. Something fled past me
up the strand, shrieking inhuman passion; the Eyes
of my enemy glared briefly across my vision.</p>

<p>One last view I glimpsed of that dread Barrier,
amid the tumult and welter of my passing. The
breach was closed! Unbroken, majestic, the enormous
Wall stood up inviolate.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">Cowper.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The uproar of rushing waters was still in my
ears. But I was in my chair before the hearth in the
living room of the farmhouse, and the noise was the
din of a tempest outside.</p>

<p>Opposite me, Phillida and Desire were clinging
together, watching me with such looks of gladness
and anxiety that I felt myself abashed before them.
Bagheera, the cat, sat on the table beside the lamp,
yellow eyes blinking at each flash and rattle of lightning
and thunder, while he sleeked his recently wetted
fur. Wondering where that wet had come from, I
discovered presently that the fire was out, and the
hearth drenched with soot-stained water. I looked
toward the windows, from which the curtains had
been drawn aside. Rain poured glistening down the
panes, but the clean storm was empty of horror.</p>

<p>"Drink some of this, Mr. Locke," urged Vere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
whose arm was about me. "Sit quiet, and I guess
you'll be all right in a few moments."</p>

<p>I took the advice. Strength was flowing into me,
as inexplicably as it had flowed away from me a while
past. How can I describe the certainty of life that
possessed me? The assurance was established, singularly
enough, for all of us. None of my companions
asked, and I myself never doubted whether the
danger might return. The experience was complete,
and closed. Moreover, already the Thing that had
been our enemy, the horror that had been Its atmosphere,
the mystery that haunted Desire&mdash;all were
fading into the past. The phantoms were exorcised,
and the house purified of fear.</p>

<p>But there was something different from ordinary
storm in this tempest. The tumult of rain and wind
linked another, deeper roar with theirs. The house
quivered with a steady trembling like a bridge over
which a train is passing. Pulling myself together
I turned to Vere.</p>

<p>"What is happening outdoors?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The cloudburst was too much for the dam,"
he answered regretfully. "It went off with a noise
like a big gun, a while back. I expect the lake is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
flooding the whole place and messing up everything
from our cellar to the chickenhouse. Daylight is due
pretty soon, now, and the storm is dying down.
We'll be able to add up the damage, after a bit."</p>

<p>"The water came down the chimney and drowned
Bagheera," Phillida bravely tried to summon nonchalance.
"Isn't it lucky you and Desire could not
get started in the car, after all? Fancy being out
in that!"</p>

<p>Desire Michell steadied her soft lips and gave
her quota to the shelter of commonplace speech we
raised between ourselves and emotions too recently felt.</p>

<p>"It was like the tropical storms in Papua, where
I lived until this year," she said. "Once, one blew
down the mission house."</p>

<p>Vere's weather prediction proved quite right. In
an hour the storm had exhausted itself, or passed
away to other places. Sunrise came with a veritable
glory of crimson and gold, blazing through air
washed limpidly pure by the rain. The east held a
troop of small clouds red as flamingoes flying against
a shining sky; last traces of our tempest.</p>

<p>We stood on the porch together to survey an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
unfamiliar scene in the rosy light. Water overlay
lawns and paths, so the house stood in a wide, shallow
lake whose ripples lapped around the white cement
steps and the pillars of the porte-coch&egrave;re. Phillida's
Pekin ducks floated and fed on this new waterway as
contentedly as upon their accustomed pastures. Small
objects sailed on the flood here and there; Bagheera's
milk-pan from the rear veranda bobbed amidst a
fleet of apples shaken down in the orchard,
while some wooden garden tools nudged a silk
canoe-cushion.</p>

<p>In contrast to all this aquatic prospect, where the
real lake had been there now lay some acres of ugly,
oozing marsh; its expanse dotted with the bodies of
dead water-creatures and such of Vere's young trout
as had not been swept away by the outpouring flood.
The dam was a mere pile of d&eacute;bris through which
trickled a stream bearing no resemblance to the
sparkling waterfall of yesterday. Already the sun's
rays were drawing a rank, unwholesome vapor from
the long-submerged surface.</p>

<p>We contemplated the ruin for a while, without
words.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>"Poor Drawls!" Phillida sighed at length. "All
your work just rubbed out!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Vere," I exclaimed impulsively.
"We will put it all back in the same shape as it was."</p>

<p>But even as I spoke, I felt an odd shock of uneasiness
and recoil from my own proposition. I did not
want the lake to be there again; or to hear the unaccountable
sounds to which it gave birth and the
varying fall of the cataract over the dam. Did the
others share my repugnance? I seemed to divine that
they did. Even the impetuous Phil did not break out
in welcome of my offer. Desire, who had smoothed
her sober gray dress in some feminine fashion and
stood like Marguerite or Melisande with a great
braid over either shoulder, moved as if to speak, then
changed her intention. A faint distress troubled
her expression.</p>

<p>As usual, Vere himself quietly lifted us out
of unrest.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that couldn't be bettered, Mr.
Locke," he demurred. "That is if you liked, of
course! That marsh could be cleaned up and
drained into pretty rich land, I guess. And down
there beyond the barn, on the other side where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
creek naturally widens out into a kind of basin, I
should think might be the spot for a smaller,
cleaner lake."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem to you, Ethan," I said, "that
we have progressed rather past the <i>Mr. Locke</i> stage?"</p>

<p>A little later, when Desire and I were alone on
the porch, we walked to the end nearest the vanished
lake. Or rather, I led her to a swinging couch there,
and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"Point out the path down the hill by which you
used to come," I asked of her.</p>

<p>She shook her head. There are no words to
paint how she looked in the clear morning, except that
she seemed its sister.</p>

<p>"It is only the end of a path that matters," she
said. "Look instead at the marsh. Do you see
nothing there stranger than a path through the woods
even when trodden by a wilful woman?"</p>

<p>Following her lifted finger, I saw a series of long
mounds out there in the muddy floor not far from
the dam. Not high, two or three feet at most, the
mounds formed an irregular square of considerable
area.</p>

<p>"The old house!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>"It was set on fire by the second Desire Michell
one night deep in winter. Her father built this house
of yours and put in the dam that covered the ruins
with water. I think he hoped to wash away the
horror upon the place."</p>

<p>"I know so little of your history."</p>

<p>"You can imagine it." She turned her head
from me. "The first child came back from England
when it was a man grown, and claimed the house and
name of the first Desire. He settled and married
here. For two generations only sons were born to the
Michells. I do not know if the Dark One came to
them. I believe it did, but they were hard, austere
men who beat off evil. Then, a daughter was born.
She looked like the first Desire and she was&mdash;not
good. She was a scandal to the family. She listened
to It&mdash;&mdash;! The tradition is that she set fire to the
house after a terrible quarrel with her people, but
herself perished by some miscalculation. There
were no more girls born for another while after that.
Not until my father's time. He had a sister who
resembled the two Desires of the past. My grandfather
brought her up in harshness and austerity,
holding always before her the wickedness to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
she was born. Yet it was no use. She fled from his
house with a man no one knew, and died in Paris
after a life of great splendor and heartlessness.
Everyone who loved the Desires suffered. That is
why I&mdash;covered myself from&mdash;you."</p>

<p>I took her hand, so small a thing to hold and
feel flutter in mine.</p>

<p>"But what of me, Desire? The darkness covered
no beauty in me, but a defect. You never saw me
until last night and now in the morning. Now that
you know, can you bear with a man who&mdash;limps?
You, so perfect?"</p>

<p>She turned toward me. Her kohl-dark eyes,
vivid as a summer noon, opened to my anxious
scrutiny.</p>

<p>"But I have seen you often," she said, the heat
of confession bright on cheek and lip. "I never
meant you to know, but now&mdash;&mdash;! After the first
time you spoke to me so kindly and gayly&mdash;I was so
very sorrowfully alone&mdash;and the convent was so dull!
My father's field-glasses were in my trunk."</p>

<p>"Desire?"</p>

<p>"I fear I have no vocation for a nun. I&mdash;there
is a huge rock half-way down the hill with a clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
view of this place. I have spent hours there, watching
these lawns and verandas, and the things you all
did. It all seemed so amusing and, and happy. You
see, where I lived there were almost no white people
except my father and a priest at the Catholic mission.
So I learned to know Phillida and Mr. Vere and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, all this time, Desire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The glasses brought you very close," she whispered.
"I knew you by night and by day."</p>

</p></div>


<p>I have come to the end of this narrative and with
the end, I come to what people of practical mind
may call its explanation. Of the four of us who were
joined in living through the events of that summer,
my wife and I and Ethan Vere agree in one belief,
while Phillida holds the opinion of her father, the
Professor. I think Bagheera, the cat, might be added
to our side also, if his testimony was available.</p>

<p>The press reports of the cloudburst and flood
brought the Professor up to Connecticut to verify
with his own eyes his daughter's safety. Aunt Caroline
did not come with him, but I may here set down
that she did come later. They found their son-in-law
by no means what their forebodings menaced,
so reconciled themselves at last to the marriage; to
Phillida's abiding joy.</p>

<p>But first the little Professor arrived alone, three
days after the storm. Characteristically, he had sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
no warning of his coming, so no one met him at the
railway station. He arrived in one of those curious
products of a country livery stable known as a rig,
driven by a local reprobate whom no prohibition
could sober.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the incredulous rapture with
which Phillida welcomed him, nor the pride with
which she presented Vere.</p>

<p>The damages to the place were already being repaired,
although weeks of work would be needed to
restore a condition of order and make the changes
we planned. The automobile had been disentangled
from the wreckage of garage and willow tree and
towed away to receive expert attention. We were
awaiting the arrival of the new car I had ordered
for the honeymoon tour Desire and I were soon to
take. Phillida had declared two weeks shopping a
necessary preliminary to the wedding of a bride who
was to live in New York "and meet everybody."
Nor would I have shortened the pretty orgy into
which the two girls entered, transforming my sorceress
into a lady of the hour; happiness seeming to
me rather to be savored than gulped.</p>

<p>Needless to say, there was no more talk of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
convent whose iron gates were to have closed between
the last Desire Michell and the world. She had been
directed there by the priest whose island mission was
near her father's. In her solitude and ignorance of
life, the sisterhood seemed to offer a refuge in which
to keep her promise to her father. But she had to
learn the principles of the Church she was about to
adopt, and during that period of delay I had come to
the old house.</p>

<p>On the second day of his visit, we told all the
story to the Professor. We could not have told
Aunt Caroline, but we told him.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly simple," he pronounced at the
end. "Interesting, even unique in points, but simple
of explanation."</p>

<p>"And what may be the explanation?" I inquired
with scepticism.</p>

<p>"Marsh gas," he replied triumphantly. "Have
none of you young people ever considered the singular
emanations from swamps and marshes where rotting
vegetation underlies shallow water? Phillida, I
am astonished that you did not enlighten your companions
on this point. You, at least, have been carefully
educated, not in the light froth of modern music<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
and art, but in the rudiments of science. I do not
intend to wound your feelings, Roger!"</p>

<p>"I am not wounded, sir," I retorted. "Just
incredulous!"</p>

<p>"Ah?" said the Professor, with the bland superiority
of his tribe. "Well, well! Yet even you know
something of the evils attending people who live in
low, swampy areas; malaria, ague, fevers. In the
tropics, these take the form of virulent maladies that
sweep a man from earth in a few hours. Your lake
<i>was</i> haunted, so was the house that once stood in its
basin, as some vague instinct strove to warn the
generations of Michells as well as you. Haunted by
emanations of some powerful form of marsh gas
given forth more plentifully at night, which lowered
the heart action and impeded the breathing of one
drawing the poison into his lungs through hours of
sleep, producing&mdash;nightmare. Science has by no means
analyzed all the possibilities of such phenomena."</p>

<p>"Nightmare!" I cried. "Do you mean to account
by nightmare for the wide and repeated experiences
that twice brought me to the verge of death? And
Desire? What of her knowledge of that same nightmare?
What of the legend of her family so exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
coinciding with all I felt? And why did not Phillida
and Ethan suffer the nightmare with me?"</p>

<p>He held up a lean hand.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, Roger! Consider that of all the
household you alone slept in the side of the house
toward the lake. I know that you always have your
windows open day and night&mdash;a habit that used to
cause great annoyance to your Aunt Caroline when
you were a boy. Thus you were exposed to the full
effect of the water gases. That you did not feel
the effects every night I attribute to differences in
the wind, that from some directions would blow the
fumes away from the house, thus relieving you. I
gather from your account that the phenomena were
most pronounced in close, foggy weather, when the
poisonous air was atmospherically held down to the
earth. You have spoken of miasmic mists that hung
below the level of the tree-tops. When Mr. Vere
experienced a similar unease and depression, he was
on the shore of the lake at dawn after precisely such
a close, foggy night as I have described as most
dangerous. The symptoms confirm this theory.
You say you awakened on each occasion with a sense
of suffocation. Your heart labored, your limbs were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
cold and mind unnaturally depressed, owing to slow
circulation of the blood. You were a man asphyxiated.
After each attack you were more sensitive to
the next, as a malaria patient grows worse if he
remains in the swamp districts. It is remarkable
that you did not guess the truth from the smell of
decaying vegetation and stagnant damp which you
admit accompanied the seizures! However, you did
not; and in your condition the last three days of
continuous fog brought on two attacks that nearly
proved fatal. Now as to the character of your hallucinations,
and their agreement with the young lady's
ideas. That is a trifle more involved discussion, yet
simple, simple!"</p>

<p>He put the tips of his fingers together and surveyed
us with the benign condescension of one instructing
a class of small children.</p>

<p>"The first night that you passed in your newly
purchased house, Roger, you accidentally encountered
Miss Michell; or she did you!" He smiled
humorously. "While your feelings were excited by
the unusual episode, the strange surroundings and
the dark, she related to you a wild legend of witchcraft
and monsters. Later, when you suffered your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
first attack of marsh-gas poisoning, your consequent
hallucination took form from the story you had just
heard. Later conversations with your mysterious
lady fixed the idea into an obsession. Recurrent
dreams are a common phenomenon even in healthy
persons. In this case, no doubt the exact repetition
of the physical sensations of miasmic poisoning
tended to reproduce in your mind the same sequence
of ideas or semi-delirious imaginings. These were
of course varied or distorted somewhat on each occasion,
influenced by what you had been hearing or
reading in advance of them. This mental condition
became more and more confirmed as you steeped
yourself more deeply in legendary lore and also&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;in the morbid fancies of the young
lady; whose ghostly visits in the dark and whose
increasing interest for you put a further bias upon
your thoughts."</p>

<p>"What were the noises I heard from the lake,
and the shocks we all felt?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He nodded amiably toward Vere.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vere has mentioned the large bubbles which
formed and burst on the surface of the lake. That
is a common manifestation of ordinary marsh gas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Possibly the singular and unknown emanation that
took place at night came to the surface in the form of
a bubble or bubbles huge enough to produce in bursting
the smacking sound of which you speak. But I
am inclined to another theory, after a walk I took
about your place this morning. When you put up
your cement dam instead of the old log affair that held
back only a part of the stream, you made a greater
depth and bulk of water in the swamp basin than
it has contained these many years, if ever. As a
result, I believe the sloping mud basin began to slip
toward the dam. Oh, very gradually! Probably not
stirring for weeks at a time. Just a yielding here, a
parting there, until the cloudburst precipitated the
disaster. You had, my dear Roger, a miniature
landslide, which would account for sounds of shifting
mud and water in your lake, and for the shocks
or trembling of your house when the earth movements
occurred."</p>

<p>The rest of us regarded one another. I think
Vere might have spoken, if he had not been unwilling
to mar Phillida's contentment by any appearance of
dispute with her father.</p>

<p>"It is very cleverly worked out, sir," I conceded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
"But how do you explain that Desire knew what I
experienced with the Thing from the Barrier, if my
experiences were merely delirious dreams?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet understood that she did know,"
said the Professor dryly. "She put the suggestions
into your head; innocently, of course. When you
afterward compared notes and found they agreed,
you cried 'miraculous'! How is that, Miss Michell?
Did you actually know what Roger experienced in
these excursions before he told you of them?"</p>

<p>Desire gazed at him with her meditative eyes,
so darkly lovely, yet never quite to lose their individual
difference from any other lovely eyes I have ever
seen. The eyes, I thought then and still think, of one
who has seen more, or at least seen into farther
spaces, than most of treadmill-trotting humanity.
She wore one of the new frocks for which Phillida
and she had already made a flying trip to town; a
most sophisticated frock from Fifth Avenue, with
frivolous French shoes to correspond. Her hair of a
Lorelei was demurely coiled and wound about her
little head. Yet some indescribable atmosphere closed
her delicately around, an impalpable wall between her
and the commonplace. Even the desiccated, material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Professor was aware of this influence and took off
his spectacles uneasily, wiped them and put them on
again to contemplate her.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," she answered him with careful
candor. "I believe that I could always tell when the
Dark One had been with him. I could feel that,
here," she touched her breast. "I knew what its
visits were like, because I was brought up to know
by my father and was told the history of the three
Desire Michells. My father had studied deeply and
taught me&mdash;I shall not tell anyone all he taught me!
I do not want to think of those things. Some of
them I have told to Roger. Some of them are quite
harmless and pleasant, like the secret formula for
making the Rose of Jerusalem perfume; which has
virtues not common, as Roger can say who has felt it
revive him from faintness. But there are places into
which we should not thrust ourselves. It is like&mdash;like
suicide. One's mind must be perverted before
certain things can be done. And that is the true
sin&mdash;to debase one's soul. All men discover and
learn of science and the universe by honest duty and
effort is good, is lofty and leads up. Nothing is
forbidden to us. But if we turn aside to the low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
door which only opens to crime and evil purpose, we
step outside. I am unskilful; I do not express
myself well."</p>

<p>"Very well, young lady," the Professor condescended.
"Unfortunately, your theories are wild
mysticism. The veritable fiend that has plagued the
house of Michell is the mischievous habit of rearing
each generation from childhood to a belief in doom
and witchcraft. A child will believe anything it is
told. Why not, when all things are still equally
wonderful to it? Let me point out that your theory
also contradicts itself, since Roger certainly did not
enter upon any path of crime, yet he met your unearthly
monster."</p>

<p>"Because he chose to link his fate with mine, who
am linked by heredity with the Dweller at the Frontier,"
she said earnestly. "He was in the position of
one who enters the lair of a wild beast to bring out
a victim who is trapped there. It may cost that
rescuer his life. Roger nearly paid his life. But he
mastered It and took me away from It, because he
was not afraid and not seeking his own good. I
never imagined anyone so brave and strong and unsel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>fish
as Roger. I suppose it is because he thinks
of others instead of himself, which gives the strongest
kind of strength."</p>

<p>"The Thing nearly had me, though," I hastily
intervened to spare my own modesty. "And It did
have me worse than afraid!"</p>

<p>"I seem to be arguing against an impenetrable
obstinacy," snapped the Professor. "Do you, Roger,
who were educated under my own eye, in my house,
have the effrontery to tell me that you believe Miss
Michell is descended from the union of an evil spirit
and a human being; as the Eastern legends claim
for Saladin the Great?"</p>

<p>"Your own theory, sir, being&mdash;&mdash;?" I evaded.</p>

<p>"There is no theory about the matter," he declared.
"Excuse me, Miss Michell! The child was
undoubtedly Sir Austin's son. Which accounts for
the madness of the first Desire Michell."</p>

<p>We were all silent for a while. Whatever
thoughts each held remained unvoiced.</p>

<p>"Come, Phillida, you take my sane point of view,
I hope?" the Professor finally challenged his
daughter, with a glance of scorn and compassion at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the rest of our group. "You observe that I have
explained every point raised, Miss Michell's testimony
being of the vaguest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa," Phillida agreed hesitatingly. "I
do believe you have solved the whole problem. Only,
if Cousin Roger was suffering from marsh-gas poisoning
last night when he seemed to be dying, I
do not quite see why Ethan's prayer should have
cured him."</p>

<p>The Professor was momentarily posed. He
looked disconcerted, took off his glasses and put them
on again, and at length muttered something about
storm-wind dissipating the miasma in the air and
events being mere coincidence.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The house was never again visited by the Dark
Presence. Phantom or fancy, the horror was gone
as if it never had brooded about the place. Desire
Locke is a fatal companion only to my heart.</p>

<p>But whether all this is so because the lake is
drained and the Shetland pony of a young Vere
browses over the green pasture that was once a
miasmic swamp; or whether it is so for more subtle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
wilder reasons, no one can say. I, recalling that
colossal Barrier I visioned as closed and a certain
cleaving arrow of light, must at least call the coincidence
amazing.</p>

<p>As I have said, my wife and I, Ethan Vere and
Bagheera the cat have an understanding between us.</p>
